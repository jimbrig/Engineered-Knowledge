# Ansible for the Windows System Admin

Ansible is a very flexible, easy to use configuration management product. Written in [[Python]], and traditionally for [[linux]] environments, it is being used by Windows admins more and more. Also, with [[MOC - PowerShell|PowerShell]] being cross platform, we can do some really interesting things that were probably never intended by the creators. Come find out all you need to know about managing Windows machines with Ansible, and find out how much you can do without learning [[Python]]. In this talk you will learn:

- how to setup VSCode and the Windows Subsystem for [[Linux]] (WSL) to be the ultimate Ansible console
- how to get started with basic ansible tasks and an overview of the architecture and terminology
- how to connect to, and manage, Windows machines with Ansible, and the various authentication options available
- how to leverage [[MOC - PowerShell|PowerShell]] DSC resources in Ansible to do almost anything
- how to write custom Ansible modules and dynamic inventory scripts in [[MOC - PowerShell|PowerShell]] on [[linux]]

## Notes

[[MOC - PowerShell|PowerShell]] Summit videos are recorded on a "best effort" basis. We use a room mic to capture as much room audio as possible, with an emphasis on capturing the speaker. Our recordings are made in a way that minimizes overhead for our speakers and interruptions to our live audience. These recordings are meant to preserve the presentations' information for posterity, and are not intended to be a substitute for attending the Summit in person. These recordings are not intended as professional video training products. We hope you find these videos useful - the equipment used to record these was purchased using generous donations from members of the [[MOC - PowerShell|PowerShell]] community.

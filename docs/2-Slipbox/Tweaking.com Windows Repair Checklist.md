## Step 1: Do A Proper Power Reset First

Doing proper power reset is easy. It isn't the same as simply shutting down  your machine.

A proper power reset means draining all the electricity out  of the system.
This will properly reset the hardware and also clear volatile  memory, it also helps since Windows will be restarted after, clearing out any  memory leaks, not enough system resources or other problems that might get in  the way of the repairs.

Have you ever heard someone say their computer  wasn't working right, so they unhooked it, took it to a computer repair shop and  when they got there the system was working fine? This is because the power had  drained out of the system!

1. Shut down and power off the computer.
2. Once the computer is powered off, unplug the power cord. If it is a laptop also remove the battery. It is important that any way for the system to keep getting power is unplugged or unhooked.
3. With the power cord unplugged and the battery removed (if you have one), hit the power button a few times as if you are trying to turn on the computer. When you  do this and the computer tries to turn on, all the electricity is drained out of  the system.
4. Plug the power cord back in and reinsert the battery (if you have one) and turn the computer on.

Once Windows is loaded you can continue on with the other steps  and repairs.

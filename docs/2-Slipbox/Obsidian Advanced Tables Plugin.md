# Obsidian Advanced Tables Plugin

# Advanced Tables Help

The Advanced Tables plugin for Obsidian adds a lot of new features to editing
Markdown tables within Obsidian, while maintaining full compatibility
with Markdown.

As commonly ask questions arise they will be added below:

## Using Formulas in Markdown Tables

Formulas are written on the line immediately following the table. For more
information on the formula syntax please take a look at [this
document](https://github.com/tgrosinger/md-advanced-tables/blob/main/docs/formulas.md)
which contains detailed explanation and helpful examples.

<https://github.com/tgrosinger/md-advanced-tables/blob/main/docs/formulas.md>

Evaluating formulas is done using the formulas button in the toolbar.

## Sorting Rows

When using the sort option in the toolbar, the sort will be performed based
on the column the cursor is currently in.

## Additional Questions

If you have additional questions which are not covered here, please [create

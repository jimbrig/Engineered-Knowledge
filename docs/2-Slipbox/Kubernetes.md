## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes, or k8s for short, is an open source platform, pioneered by Google, which started as a simple container orchestration tool but has grown into a cloud-native platform. It’s one of the most significant advancements in IT since the public cloud came to being in 2009 and has an unparalleled 5-year 30% growth rate in both market revenue and overall adoption.

Kubernetes is popular for its appealing architecture, a large and active community and the continuous need for extensibility that enables countless development teams to deliver and maintain software at scale by automating container orchestration.

Kubernetes maps out how applications should work and interact with other applications. Due to its elasticity, it can scale services up and down as required, perform rolling updates, switch traffic between different versions of your applications to test features or rollback problematic deployments.

Kubernetes has emerged as a leading choice for organisations looking to build their multi-cloud environments. All public clouds have adopted Kubernetes and offer their own distributions, such as AWS Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes, Google Kubernetes Engine and Azure Kubernetes Service.


## What are containers?

Containers are a technology that allows the user to divide up a machine so that it can run more than one application (in the case of process containers) or operating system instance (in the case of system containers) on the same kernel and hardware while maintaining isolation among the workloads. Containers are a modern way to virtualise infrastructure, more lightweight approach than traditional virtual machines: all containers in single host OS share the kernel and other resources, require less memory space, ensure greater resource utilisation and shorter startup times by several orders of magnitude.



Inside Google alone, at least two billion containers are generated each week to manage its vast operations.

Kubernetes history and ecosystem
Kubernetes (from the Greek ‘κυβερνήτης’ meaning ‘helmsman’) was originally developed by Google, Kubernete’s design has been heavily influenced by Google’s ‘Borg’ project – a similar system used by Google to run much of its infrastructure. Kubernetes has since been donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, a collaborative project between the Linux Foundation and Google, Cisco, IBM, Docker, Microsoft, AWS and VMware.

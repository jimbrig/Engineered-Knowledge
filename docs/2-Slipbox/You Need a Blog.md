# You Need a Blog

![](https://www.donnfelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/you-need-a-blog-1024x678.jpg)

Yeah, that‚Äôs right. You need one.

Maybe you already have one. If you do, you might be reading this  
and thinking ‚Ä¶

_Crap I haven‚Äôt written anything in a long time._

_Why?_

Who knows. I was that way. Sometimes I still am. The last couple  
of years my blog has been a desert riddled with occasional posts.

Why?

**I got lazy.**

_I have a HUGE list of ideas I have written down in Evernote of_  
_blog posts I want to write._ Some of them are pure GOLD. Like, Why  
Recruiters are your Secret Weapon ‚Äì Utilize the tool everyone  
ignores to dominate in consulting.

Sounds interesting, right? Who wouldn‚Äôt want to have a constant  
flow of clients? Who wouldn‚Äôt want to eliminate that fear of ‚ÄúOh  
no, I don‚Äôt have a client and my bills are due, and my car  
payment is late, and we‚Äôre having a kid in 6 weeks. GREAT. I‚Äôm  
screwed‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been there. So, yeah‚Ä¶. You need a blog. Why? From my  
experience, I‚Äôve found it to be very lucrative ‚Ä¶

But again ‚Ä¶

Why didn‚Äôt I do it? Yeah, I was lazy, but also ‚Ä¶.

**It wasn‚Äôt a priority.** I‚Äôm working on it though. You may have  
noticed that some of these posts that are on my email list end up  
on my blog.

Again, why am I doing that?

The better question is ‚Äì why not?

Reach is reach. Any movement forward is positive movement. I‚Äôll  
be talking about repurposing content in the near future, but  
that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing here. I‚Äôll talk about reach and marketing  
more and more as we continue, but for now, this is about why you  
need a blog, an active blog.

Which brings me back to what people often ask me:

> Donn, how I can grow my exposure and get my name out in the  
> community so that people know me?

I usually say this:

> **You need a blog.**

They usually look at me with eyes of bewilderment and I quickly  
intercept that look with a question.

_‚ÄúSeems like you don‚Äôt believe me. Why?‚Äù_

Usually, the retort is that ‚ÄúBlogs are dead‚Äù and ‚Äú_No one reads_  
_blogs_‚Äù.

**Nonsense.**

_Do you know who reads blogs?_

Google. Bing. DuckDuckGo. etc.

**Do you know who uses those search engines? All of us.**

**Do you know who reads your articles that the search engines find?**  
**All of us.**

_Ah, makes sense right?_

How many times have you searched for something online and ran  
across an article that explained what you needed? _Probably a_  
_lot._

How many times has a friend sent you a link to something that was  
interesting? _Probably a lot._

How many times have you seen an article linked from another site  
that led to a blog? Probably a lot.

See what I mean?

Blogs are everywhere. There are thousands upon thousands of  
people making a crap-ton of money off their blogs.

I‚Äôm not, or am I?

I don‚Äôt sell anything on my blog. Sure, I have a few affiliate  
links, but that generates enough revenue for a few Chipotle  
burritos a month (no complaints there, feel free to send me all  
your burritos ‚Äì I‚Äôll eat‚Äôm).

**But yes, my blog does make money.** _In fact, it‚Äôs made me more_  
_money than I can ever have fathomed. How?_

Exposure.

That‚Äôs right. Exposure. The kind of exposure that I didn‚Äôt  
expect.

When I started my blog I wrote about how to do things with given  
languages. From C# to databases, to Rails, to Node/etc. I still  
write about those things. However, at the time, my main focus was  
on sharing what I learned with the world via my blog.

If I created a cool way to handle errors in a resilient way, I‚Äôd  
blog about it and show people how I did it.

If I created a cool geo utility class to help perform geolocation  
with one line of code, I‚Äôd share that implementation on the  
blog.

‚Ä¶ and then this one ‚Ä¶ **this one is the hidden gem:**

If I ran into an error in programming that had no results on any  
of the search engines, I‚Äôd blog about how I finally fixed it.  
Let‚Äôs say the error message was ‚ÄúCM00234 Not Found During  
Processing‚Äù. I‚Äôd title my blog post: ‚ÄúHow to Fix: CM00234 Found  
During Processing‚Äù and then I‚Äôd show people how I fixed it in my  
situation.

Guess what?

Do you know who ranked #1 on Google for ‚ÄúCM00234 Not Found During  
Processing‚Äù? (This is not a real blog post, just an example).

My blog.

If you want to see a real-world example, Google this ‚Äú[Syntax  
Highlighting for .build and .msbuild‚Äù](https://www.google.com/search?q=Syntax+Highlighting+for+.build+and+.msbuild)

**Guess who‚Äôs #1 on Google?**

**My blog.**

_That post is 12 years old._ Yes, there is even a broken image that  
is on that page and it‚Äôs super old, but this illustrates how you  
can rank your content easily.

_This is known as long tail keyword ranking._

Long tail keywords are very specific and you have a higher chance  
of rating higher on Google.

**Guess what happens when you rank higher on Google?**

**More exposure.**

_What happens when you get more exposure?_ More people know about  
you.

This is a fantastic way to start blogging. Simply share what  
you‚Äôve worked on, and how it worked for you or share a fix to an  
error that was very tricky that you could not find an answer for  
online. Most likely, others are running into this as well and  
they can‚Äôt find a solution. Posting your solution on your blog  
will help them out.

This will lead to more exposure, FOR YOU.

This is a good thing ‚Ä¶ let me tell you a quick story before I  
wrap up ‚Ä¶

In 2009, my first full-time independent contract was coming to a  
close. I was getting paid $90 an hour as a web dev. I was  
blogging one to two times a week using this method above (sharing  
what I learned, how to fix errors, etc) and all of a sudden I got  
a cold email from a guy named Jesse from the contact form on my  
blog. Jesse worked as a contractor at GMAC (now known as Ally  
Bank). He saw that I was writing about some of the stuff they  
were dealing with at GMAC and asked if I had any capacity to help  
them.

A week later I had lunch with their team to see if it was a fit  
(it was a mini interview for the team and to gauge my knowledge)  
and I was a fit! In about 2-3 weeks I started working at GMAC for  
$125 an hour. ‚Äì a 28% raise ‚Ä¶ from a blog post. This contract  
lasted almost two years and then I eventually wrote the Android  
book and moved onto Android consulting.

I‚Äôve seen this happen to MANY people over the years. MANY.

Long story short ‚Äì this ONLY happened because of my blog. Jesse  
was a reader of my blog and saw that I knew what I was talking  
about. I was simply sharing the knowledge that I had learned from  
coding and doing my day to day duties. This turned into an  
opportunity ‚Äì a very lucrative one.

So yeah ‚Ä¶ my blog does make money.

How?

Exposure.

It exposed what I knew to Jesse, through some indirect way ‚Äì he  
found it online, perhaps through a search, someone sending a link  
to him, who knows. I still don‚Äôt know to this day how he found  
it. That led to him emailing me and then before I knew it, I was  
working with him and his team.

If I had NOT been blogging, I would not be in the position I am  
in now. I‚Äôm not saying this exact thing is going to happen to  
you, but I do know a blog has helped my career immensely and I‚Äôve  
seen it help others in fantastic ways too.

Which brings me to ‚Ä¶

The two best things I‚Äôve ever done in my career has been to start  
blogging and start speaking ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre starting to see why  
now.

If you don‚Äôt have a blog, there are many places you can set them  
up. Some are great, others ‚Ä¶ not-so-much. I‚Äôll talk about the  
various options you have in the next email ‚Äì stay tuned.

If you haven‚Äôt written anything for your blog in a while, or if  
your not sure even what you‚Äôd talk about please hit the comment section below and let know. I‚Äôd love to learn how I can help you get it started.

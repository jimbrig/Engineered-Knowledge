# Prioritize these 5 Essentials of Healthy Achievement

Prioritize these 5 essentials of healthy achievement:

1. **Rest.** Practice rest by getting adequate sleep every night and avoiding work on your days off.
2. **Reflection.** Start a habit of pulling away to a quiet place to pause and reflect. Slow down for as little as 5 minutes to center yourself and reflect on your life’s direction.
3. **Relationships.** Get intentional about building in-person relationships. This opens up a world of learning, encouragement, and accountability. 
4. **Refreshment.** Stay mindful about what you eat. Consume foods that will contribute to your productivity and be good, clean fuel—not stuff that’ll bog you down the rest of the day.
5. **Recreation.** Pursue leisure activities that restore your body. Develop non-work-related interests and hobbies to give your brain the break it needs.

By focusing on the 5 Rs above, you’ll avoid burnout and restore the energy you need to *win at work and succeed at life.

## Highlights -  [[What Blog Platform Should I Use]]

- YOU SHOULD NOT BE FOCUSING ON BUILDING SOFTWARE TO RUN A BLOG[^5]
- In other words, if you’re a software engineer (and some of you are) you should not get consumed with “building my blog” with some latest and greatest technology that you can learn along the way.[^5]
- All of that is a waste of time if your goal is to start writing a blog.[^5]
- So focus on writing – not on building a blog engine.[^5]
- Choosing a platform can turn into a serious case of analysis paralysis. I hope to solve that for you today by comparing some of the top platforms and what they have to offer (on the good and bad front).[^5]
- Everyone loves Medium because it’s drop dead simple to get started with blogging. You can sign up for a free account and then start writing in their editor in less than a minute.[^5]
- WordPress is the market leader for these types of sites (blogs). It has a rich plugin ecosystem that will be ready for you to grow when you need it and hosting with companies like WpEngine ensure your website is fast and secure. You’ll find that as you need more from WordPress, it can offer almost anything you need. Last piece of advice – try to build everything without code first. WordPress allowed me to do that. It forced me to focus on my content and not on some cool engineering that ultimately would have acted as a distraction.[^5]

# Highlights - Mindfulness

- *Addiction to Information* can cause a complete breakdown of one's ability to stay mindful and focused on staying accountable, getting results, and finishing your work*[^7]
- It is very easy to get lost down a rabbit hole and create an unhealthy environment consumed by insignificant, yet vast amounts of unnecessary information, overloading your ability to stay mindful and on-task.[^7]
- Mindfulness requires more than action, it require deep behavioral and psychological strength and stability to build up over time. In other words, change the way you think in order to think about the ways you act.[^7]
- Counter-intuitive and often simple solutions frequently solve the grandest farthest reaching problems. Thinking and forcing deep mental endeavors is more valuable, healthy, and efficient than deciding to find an easy, shallow, thoughtless solution.[^7]
- Irrational thinking due to addiction to technology and information. Dive deeper into the things I am already pursuing myself. Stop consuming redundant information phrased differently. Instead, building on what I already know and using the resources I have mentally retained due to actual helpfulness stems a much quicker and elegant solution.[^7]

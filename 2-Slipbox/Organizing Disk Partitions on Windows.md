# Organizing Disk Partitions on Windows

Dividing your hard disk into several partitions can help you organize your data better and keep you machine running smoothly. 

Keeping your Operating System (OS) and Applications separate from your data will simplify your backups/recovery and may increase your PCâ€™s performance. 

If you use more than one OS on your PC then it really makes sense to split out disks into separate partitions by OS.  That way you would be able to access your data from whichever OS you are booting from.

Before you begin, you should first decide on how you want to organize your data. 

For example, you might want to have a partition for documents, another for images or video. 

I generally follow a more broad approach and split out my partitions into something along the lines of:

- OS/Windows Partition (C:)
- Data Partition (D:)
- Archive Partition (A:)
- Backup Partition (B:)

Plus the default Windows partitions which include not only the default C drive primary boot partition, but also:

- Reserved System Partition (Hidden

On my netbook, I have a partition for work related data, one for personal and one for archive.

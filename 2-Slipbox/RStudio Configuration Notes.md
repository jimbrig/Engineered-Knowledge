Assuming you already have [[MOC - R|R]] installed, next you will need to install an IDE to code with, in this case, RStudio.

## Installation

Install the free Version of RStudio Desktop for Windows from the RStudio Website here: [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Alternatively, use a [[Package Managers|package manager]] such as [[Chocolatey]], [[Scoop]], or [[WinGet CLI Setup and Settings|Winget]]:

```powershell
# chocolatey
cinst rstudio -y

# scoop
scoop install rstudio # --global if want system-wide

# winget
winget install RStudio.RStudio.OpenSource
```

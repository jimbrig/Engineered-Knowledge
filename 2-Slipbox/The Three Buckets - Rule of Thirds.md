I learned one simple thing years ago that helped me more than I think anything else I’ve learned in awhile.

What is it?

> You can’t make everyone happy.

I’ve tried. It just doesn’t work.

When you do try to make everyone happy you eventually end up feeling **defeated and burned out**. At the end of the day you’ve wasted part of your life on trying to please people who do not want to be pleased.

I eventually learned to accept what I call the rule of thirds. I’m not the first one to come up with this, but it is very useful so I thought I’d share it here.

### The Three Buckets (The Rule of Thirds)

The rule of thirds is a mental system which you can apply to your day to day life to help alleviate the mental load of worrying about making everyone happy.

**The rule of thirds is as follows …  
**When you create something in life (a business, products, a presentation, public speaking, an idea, something at work, etc – it doesn’t matter .. its anything) people are going to react in one of three ways:

-   Positive – 1/3 of people are going to be positive about it
-   Indifferent – 1/3 of people are going to be indifferent about it
-   Negative – 1/3 of people are going to be negative about it

As soon as you realize that this is the way the world works, the easier things become.

Give a presentation on XYZ Topic at your local MeetUp? Most may like it, some may hate it, and some are indifferent.

You can’t make everyone happy … and that’s ok.

Thats why this world is great. We all have different opinions, emotions and things we enjoy. Everyone is unique.

So the next time someone trolls you online about something you’ve done, **just realize what bucket they’re in and move on with your life**. Don’t let it disrupt your day.

# Notes on Finishing Projects

## **Set Limitations**

- **Time**: Force time constraints on yourself to avoid wasting useless time that does not reach you closer to your end [desired outcome](desired%20outcome).

- **Tools**: Limit the number of possible tools at your disposal. There's never enough time to try them all out and is a perfect excuse for you to trick yourself into thinking you're *being productive* when you are just **procrastinating**.

- **Undo's**: This is a big one. Limit yourself to *avoid resetting and undoing projects mid-development at all costs*. **Learn to live with imperfection.**

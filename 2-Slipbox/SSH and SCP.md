# SSH and SCP

SSH stands for *Secure Shell* while SCP stands for *Secure Copt* where both commands allow one to interact between machines using the shell. 

## SCP

SCP is used a lot in deployments to legacy, on-prem servers allowing one to transfer application code files onto the server in a secure fashion. For example the program on Windows [[WinSCP]] utilizes SCP protocols to setup a secure connection between the local client and remote server and transfers files using SCP commands.

SCP is also helpful when dealing with [[Virtual Machines]] and [[Cloud Hosted Environments]].

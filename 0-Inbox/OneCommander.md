# One Commander

One Commander is a powerful and flexible dual-pane file manager for Microsoft Windows, using folder columns that make navigating complex folder tree structures fast and intuitive.

## Opening One Commander for the First Time

One Commander is a dual-pane file manager, meaning that it can simultaneously display either one or two independent file browsers within the same window. The browsers can be viewed either in the Standard Layout, with a navigation pane at the top and a detailed view of the current folder at the bottom, or in a more compact Columns Layout.

The first time you open One Commander:  

1.  You'll be asked if you want to import Favorites from One Commander Version 2 (the Microsoft Store version).
2.  You'll be given the choice of which [layout](https://onecommander.com/help/2._Quick_introductory_guide/3._The_Main_Window.html "layout") you'd prefer, as well as which [theme:](https://onecommander.com/help/2._Quick_introductory_guide/8._Themes.html "theme:")

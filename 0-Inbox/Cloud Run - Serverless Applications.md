# Cloud Run: Serverless Applications with Steren Giannini

Serverless computing is a cloud computing solution that lets developers deploy applications to containers without managing the servers themselves. Servers and resources are provisioned automatically, pay only for what you use, and experience little to no errors or downtime (ionos).

Google Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables you to run containers that are invocable via requests or events. Cloud Run is serverless, transparent, and easy to use. Common use cases include web services like REST APIs, data processing, automation, and modernization (cloud.google.com).

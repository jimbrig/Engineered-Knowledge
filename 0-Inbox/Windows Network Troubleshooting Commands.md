# Windows Network Troubleshooting Commands

## ipconfig

Run `ipconfig` to list all connections:

```powershell
ipconfig
```

 Look for the name of your Wi-Fi network within the results, and then find the IP address listed next to **Default gateway** for that Wi-Fi network.  *For example:  192.168.1.1_

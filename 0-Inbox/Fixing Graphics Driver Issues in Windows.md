# Fixing Graphics Driver Issues in Windows

Graphics drivers can be a serious annoyance in windows and all operating systems. Whether using defaults, [[NVIDIA]], [[Intel]], or whatever, dealing with the constant updates and configuration adjustments is an endeavor most would prefer to avoid.

## Device Manager

To access Window's Device Manager simply search for it or utilize the [[WinX PowerUser Menu]] by pressing `Win + X` and selecting Device Manager.

Once insider device manager navigate to *Display Adapters* where the graphics drivers are listed. For me these are:
- Intel(R) UHD Graphics
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super

If you right click on one of these display adapters, you have options to Update, Disable or Uninstall the driver. Additionally, if you select Properties > Driver you can view more information and specifications regarding the driver.  

A good way to fix issues related to display adapters is to simply remove the driver all together

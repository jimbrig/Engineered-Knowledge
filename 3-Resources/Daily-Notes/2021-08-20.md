## Scratchpad üìù

### Obsidian Notes

- [[YAML]] Frontmatter in Obsidian supports `tags`, `aliases`, and `cssclass` by default.

-  Notes can have multiple aliases, i.e.:

```
---
aliases: [Alias1, Alias2]
---
```

- Use aliases to link to original page with difference terms


- Change/alter obsidian publish styling with the `publish.css` file located in root level directory of vault.
	- Can copy current used theme's [[CSS]] file from `<VAULT>/.obsidian/themes/<CURRENT_THEME>/` as a starting point.

- Link to blocks in notes via `[[filename^]]` and utilize `[[^^` to search for blocks across all files.
	- Example block link: [[README#^7beeef]]

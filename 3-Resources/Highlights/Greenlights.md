The sooner we become less impressed with our life, our accomplishments, our career, our relationships, the prospects in front of us—the sooner we become less impressed and more involved with these things—the sooner we get better at them. We must be more than just happy to be here. %% highlight_id: 236769279 %%

I never wrote things down to remember; I always wrote things down so I could forget. %% highlight_id: 236769282 %%


Catching greenlights is about skill: intent, context, consideration, endurance, anticipation, resilience, speed, and discipline. We can catch more greenlights by simply identifying where the red lights are in our life, and then change course to hit fewer of them. %% highlight_id: 236769283 %%


“It is not about win or lose, it is about do you accept the challenge,” %% highlight_id: 236769284 %%

You ever get in a rut? Stuck on the merry-go-round of a bad habit? We are going to make mistakes — own them, make amends, and move on. Guilt and regret kill many a man before their time. Get off the ride. You are the author of the book of your life. Turn the page. %% highlight_id: 236769287 %%


I’ve never felt like a victim. I have a lot of proof that the world is conspiring to make me happy. %% highlight_id: 236769288 %%

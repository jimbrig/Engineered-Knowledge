Cloud computing is the use of a network of remote servers that are hosted on the internet. These remote servers are used to store, manage and process data without the need for a local server or a personal computer. There are several advantages of cloud computing that enable companies and individuals to more efficiently use computer hardware and software. %% highlight_id: 210200529 %%


The use of serverless computer networks has proven to help many companies provide more on-demand computer system resources. These resources on a serverless network include data storage and power for many computers in a network. The development of serverless computing has enabled many businesses to save money as well as have better access to certain data. Serverless computing has also allowed companies and individuals to use computers that run better with the enhanced power provided. %% highlight_id: 210200530 %%


8 benefits of the cloud for software developers %% highlight_id: 210200531 %%


1. Scalability
One of the main benefits of cloud computing is scalability. With traditional server hosting, users need to determine the exact hardware that each node of the system would run a particular web application or server. With cloud systems, users can now scale any part of an application more quickly and easily. %% highlight_id: 210200532 %%


2. Cost
Another benefit of cloud computing systems is that the cost is much less. Companies and users will be able to save money on computing costs as they will not need any upfront investment and will be able to pay as they go to get the resources they need. %% highlight_id: 210200533 %%


3. Quick Provisioning of Resources
Developers are now able to quickly create new environments for websites as well as databases and virtual machines. They are also able to get additional services that are always being expanded. %% highlight_id: 210200534 %%


4. Multiple Service Models
Cloud provides developers and companies with different options to set up their environment which will then meet the unique needs of users. These service models include Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. This has been made possible thanks to Itsm management software. %% highlight_id: 210200535 %%


5. Geographic Reach
Rather than rely on a single location to host software, cloud allows users to host applications in data centers all over the world. %% highlight_id: 210200536 %%


6. Ease of Deployment
A cloud system enables users to configure automated builds that can deploy certain code, databases, automated testing for applications and automatic provisioning of a particular server. %% highlight_id: 210200537 %%


7. Advanced Services
Cloud can allow developers and companies to use the most advanced services available These services include simplifying microservices and scaling service containers. This results in focusing on building the logic of a business instead of managing systems that are distributed. %% highlight_id: 210200538 %%


8. Monitoring Developer Operations
Developers can benefit from the cloud by being able to more easily monitor all of the operations and applications that they use. They can see application performance metrics, logs and monitoring tools to identify problems with a server or system before a user reports them. %% highlight_id: 210200539 %%

Achieving a goal. When you work for yourself, all you do is set your own goals. If you don\u2019t achieve your goals in business you\u2019ll fail fast and hard. Getting things done in a self-directed manner is paramount to your success. Self-discipline = Success. \u2691 Even something as simple as striking something off of a list feels good. I\u2019m not talking about some massive goals (though those are also great to complete) \u2013 here I\u2019m talking about any goal. Small goals. Big goals. Huge goals. Anything. Getting things done just feels good. Let me give you an example \u2026 The other day I came back from a trip to Miami. When I got home I knew I needed to bring my bags in, unpack my bags, put things away and get ready for the next day. I also needed to spend some time with my children because I missed them and had been gone for nearly 6 days. I also needed to write 1000 words for a new book I\u2019m working on (as well as reply to some of you who have replied to some of my emails \u2013 thank you all by the way). I got home at 715pm and usually go to bed at 9:30pm-10pm. There\u2019s not much time to do all fo that. So I got after it as soon as the car was parked in the garage \u2026 My first goal was to get our car unpacked. I parked and immediately brought everything in a couple trips. Goal achieved. That felt good. Next goal: Get the bags upstairs and unpack. I brought them up, and then immediately got interrupted by the kids\u2019 bedtime routine. For the next hour or so I helped them get ready for bed, showers, talked to them about their week and spent quality time with them. It ended with some much-needed affection between us all. Spend time with kids: Goal achieved That felt good. It was now 8:45 pm and I\u2019m already getting tired. I still had to unpack my bags. Ugh. At this point I\u2019m tired, I want to start winding down. \u201cI can do this tomorrow\u201d. NO. I pushed through the desire to relax and unpacked my bags, put everything away and put my luggage away where it belongs. It doesn\u2019t even look like I traveled anymore. Unpack bags: Goal achieved That felt pretty good. So glad that is done. In fact, that gave me some energy and inspiration to keep going. I like this. I remembered that I needed to schedule some contractors to give us some quotes on having some hardwood floors installed in part of our house. Since it was a small goal I figured \u201cI\u2019ll just do that tomorrow.\u201d Then I realized \u201c NO, DUMMY, you can do that right now, online in a few minutes. \u201d I stopped what I was doing and scheduled a contractor online to come over next week. Schedule contractor for a quote: Goal achieved That felt good. Damn, another thing is done. Hell yeah. I\u2019m getting some momentum. I\u2019m starting to feel REAL GOOD because I\u2019m accomplishing a lot. After that, I sit down, turn off notifications on my computer and crank out 1000 words for my upcoming book (more on that later) and by then it\u2019s around 10:15 pm. Past my bedtime. Write 1000 words: Goal achieved Goddamn, that feels good. I went out and hung out with my wife for a few minutes and then went to bed. What\u2019s the point in telling you all of this? Because setting goals, even if small, and getting them done feels good. Remember that time you created a todo list and you started to strike those items off of them throughout the day? How did you feel? I\u2019d wager that you felt pretty damn good when you were done. I feel this way about getting things done around the house, scheduling calls, writing code, writing words or copy, anything. Big goals or small goals. Inconsequential goals. Any of them feel good to get done. Even changing the cat litter, I\u2019m happy when it\u2019s done. When you set goals, even small , and continue to execute and get them done over and over, your confidence and discipline compounds. Your confidence and discipline get stronger, and well, you get better as a person. You become a better version of who you really are. Whatever goals you have right now, be it big or small. Start on them. Maybe you\u2019re feeling unproductive. Take something small, and do it. Just start it. Do something. Take out the trash. DONE. That felt good. Maybe you need to do a long intensive task on the computer and you really don\u2019t want to do it. Do it for 5 minutes, that\u2019s all. Most likely it will compound into 15-20mins (or more). This happens to me all the time. The goal is to set goals and get them done. Pun intended. Why? Achieving goals feels good and builds tremendous momentum when done over and over again. \u2691 Ride the wave of confidence into the next set of goals you have and let it propel you . Now I\u2019m off to finish my next goal \u2013 hitting publish on this post.

But what exactly does this mean? The front-end is the code that is executed on the client side. This code (typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) runs in the user\u2019s browser and creates the user interface. The back-end is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests from the clients, and contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. The back-end also includes the database, which will persistently store all of the data for the application. This article focuses on the hardware and software on the server-side that make this possible. Review HTTP and REST if you want to refresh your memory on these topics. These are the main conventions that provide structure to the request-response cycle between clients and servers. Let\u2019s start by reviewing the client-server relationship, and then we can start to put the pieces all together! What are the clients? \u2691 The clients are anything that send requests to the back-end. They are often browsers that make requests for the HTML and JavaScript code that they will execute to display websites to the end user. However, there many different kinds of clients: they might be a mobile application, an application running on another server, or even a web enabled smart appliance. What is a back-end? \u2691 The back-end is all of the technology required to process the incoming request and generate and send the response to the client. This typically includes three major parts: The server. This is the computer that receives requests. The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response. The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data. What is a server? \u2691 A server is simply a computer that listens for incoming requests. Though there are machines made and optimized for this particular purpose, any computer that is connected to a network can act as a server. In fact, you will often use your very own computer as server when developing apps. What are the core functions of the app? \u2691 The server runs an app that contains logic about how to respond to various requests based on the HTTP verb and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) . The pair of an HTTP verb and a URI is called a route and matching them based on a request is called routing . Some of these handler functions will be middleware . In this context, middleware is any code that executes between the server receiving a request and sending a response. These middleware functions might modify the request object, query the database, or otherwise process the incoming request. Middleware functions typically end by passing control to the next middleware function, rather than by sending a response. Eventually, a middleware function will be called that ends the request-response cycle by sending an HTTP response back to the client. Often, programmers will use a framework like Express or Ruby on Rails to simplify the logic of routing. For now, just think that each route can have one or many handler functions that are executed whenever a request to that route (HTTP verb and URI) is matched. What kinds of responses can a server send? \u2691 The data that the server sends back can come in different forms. For example, a server might serve up an HTML file, send data as JSON, or it might send back only an HTTP status code . You\u2019ve probably seen the status code \u201c404 - Not Found\u201d whenever you've tried navigating to a URI that doesn\u2019t exist, but there are many more status codes that indicate what happened when the server received the request. What is a database, and why do we need to use them? \u2691 Databases are commonly used on the back-end of web applications. These databases provide an interface to save data in a persistent way to memory. Storing the data in a database both reduces the load on the main memory of the server CPU and allows the data to be retrieved if the server crashes or loses power. Many requests sent to the server might require a database query. A client might request information that is stored in the database, or a client might submit data with their request to be added to the database. What is a Web API, really? \u2691 An API is a collection of clearly defined methods of communication between different software components. More specifically, a Web API is the interface created by the back-end: the collection of endpoints and the resources these endpoints expose. A Web API is defined by the types of requests that it can handle, which is determined by the routes that it defines, and the types of responses that the clients can expect to receive after hitting those routes. One Web API can be used to provide data for different front-ends. Since a Web API can provide data without really specifying how the data is viewed, multiple different HTML pages or mobile applications can be created to view the data from the Web API. Other principles of the request-response cycle: \u2691 The server typically cannot initiate responses without requests! Every request needs a response, even if it\u2019s just a 404 status code indicating that the content was not found. Otherwise your client will be left hanging (indefinitely waiting). The server should not send more than one response per request. This will throw errors in your code. Mapping out a request \u2691 Let\u2019s make all of this a bit more concrete, by following an example of the main steps that happen when a client makes a request to the server. Alice is shopping on SuperCoolShop.com. She clicks on a picture of a cover for her smartphone, and that click event makes a GET request to http://www.SuperCoolShop.com/products/66432 . Remember, GET describes the kind of request (the client is just asking for data, not changing anything). The URI (uniform resource identifier) /products/66432 specifies that the client is looking for more information about a product, and that product, has an id of 66432. SuperCoolShop has an huge number of products, and many different categories for filtering through them, so the actual URI would be more complicated than this. But this is the general principle for how requests and resource identifiers work. Alice\u2019s request travels across the internet to one of SuperCoolShop\u2019s servers. This is one of the slower steps in the process, because the request cannot go faster than the speed of light, and it might have a long distance to travel. For this reason, major websites with users all over the world will have many different servers, and they will direct users to the server that is closest to them! The server, which is actively listening for requests from all users, receives Alice\u2019s request! Event listeners that match this request (the HTTP verb: GET, and the URI: /products/66432 ) are triggered. The code that runs on the server between the request and the response is called middleware . In processing the request, the server code makes a database query to get more information about this smartphone case. The database contains all of the other information that Alice wants to know about this smartphone case: the name of the product, the price of the product, a few product reviews, and a string that will provide a path to the image of the product. The database query is executed, and the database sends the requested data back to the server. It\u2019s worth noting that database queries are one of the slower steps in this process. Reading and writing from static memory is fairly slow, and the database might be on a different machine than the original server. This query itself might have to go across the internet! The server receives the data that it needs from the database, and it is now ready to construct and send its response back to the client. This response body has all of the information needed by the browser to show Alice more details (price, reviews, size, etc) about the phone case she\u2019s interested in. The response header will contain an HTTP status code 200 to indicate that the request has succeeded. The response travels across the internet, back to Alice\u2019s computer. Alice\u2019s browser receives the response and uses that information to create and render the view that Alice ultimately sees!

Description: \u2691 autoload creates a promise-to-evaluate autoloader and stores it with name name in the .AutoloadEnv environment. When R attempts to evaluate name , autoloader is run, the package is loaded and name is re-evaluated in the new package's environment ! The result is that R behaves as if package was loaded but it does not occupy memory. .Autoloaded contains the names of the packages for which autoloading has been promised. Usage \u2691 autoload : autoload(name, package, reset = FALSE, ...) autoloader : autoloader(name, package, ...) .AutoloadEnv : see below .Autoloaded : see below Arguments \u2691 name - string giving the name of an object package - string giving the name of a package containing the object reset - logical: for internal use by autoloader ... - other arguments to library Examples \u2691 require ( stats ) autoload ( \"interpSpline\" , \"splines\" ) search () ls ( \"Autoloads\" ) . Autoloaded x <- sort ( stats :: rnorm ( 12 )) y <- x ^ 2 is <- interpSpline ( x , y ) search () ## now has splines detach ( \"package:splines\" ) search () is2 <- interpSpline ( x , y + x ) search () ## and again detach ( \"package:splines\" ) My Take \u2691 I find autoload extremely useful for incorporating functions from packages in my Rprofile . For example, I like to utilized magrittr's %>% pipe and usually do not want to have to library it in for ad-hoc analysis on the fly; therefore by including autoload(\"%>%\", \"magrittr\") in my .Rprofile , I have complete access to %>% without magrittr cluttering up my search path or namespaced environment (especially useful on Windows). With that snippet included in my .Rprofile I can use %>% later on in the same R session and magrittr will not get attached until I use it. Other ideas for autoload useful functions would be: dplyr 's suite: mutate , filter , select , etc. lubdridate 's ymd and other date utility functions fs 's file navigation functions. ... Reduce \u2691 Reduce function (note the capital \u201cR\u201d). Reduce takes a list or vector as input, and reduces it down to a single element. It works by applying a function to the first two elements of the vector or list, and then applying the same function to that result with the third element. This new result gets passed with the fourth element into the function and so on until a single object remains. If the input is a vector, the result will be a single number or character. On the other hand, inputting a list can have interesting results. A list of data frames can be reduced down to a single data frame, a list of vectors can be collapsed into a matrix, and so on. A simple, though not entirely useful, example of how this works is like so: test <- 1 : 10 result <- Reduce ( sum , test ) Here, result will equal 55 , which happens to be the sum of the vector test i.e. the sum of the integers 1 through 10. Reduce solves for this by first applying the sum function to 1 and 2 (the first two elements in test). This equals 3, which then gets summed with the next element in the vector, 3. This total of 6 gets added to 4, which equals 10, and so on. The process can be seen below. $1 + 2 = 3$ $3 + 3 = 6$ $6 + 4 = 10$ $10 + 5 = 15$ $15 + 6 = 21$ $21 + 7 = 28$ $28 + 8 = 36$ $36 + 9 = 45$ $45 + 10 = 55$ Now, how about something a little more useful? What if you had a list of vectors and you wanted to combine them into a matrix? test <- list ( 1 : 3 , 4 : 6 , 7 : 9 , 10 : 12 , 13 : 15 , 16 : 18 ) matrix_result <- Reduce ( rbind , test ) In this case, we have a list of six three-element vectors. Reduce applies rbind to the first two vectors, 1:3 and 4:6 initially. This creates a 2 x 3 matrix, where the first row is 1:3, and the second row is 4:6. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Then, the above result is combined (via rbind ) to the next vector in the list, 7:9. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 This process continues, as you can see below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Next: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Finally: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Thus, the final result is a single object \u2014 but in this case, is a 6 x 3 matrix because rbind collapsed all of the vectors of the list, test, into a single matrix. Similarly, you could run this example using cbind instead of rbind and that would collapse the vectors column-wise, rather than row-wise. Another example where Reduce comes in handy might be if you want to combine a collection of data frames into a single one. state_data <- list ( FL = data.frame ( state = c ( \"FL\" , \"FL\" , \"FL\" ), city = c ( \"Miami\" , \"Jacksonville\" , \"Saint Augustine\" )), NY = data.frame ( state = c ( \"NY\" , \"NY\" , \"NY\" ), city = c ( \"NYC\" , \"Buffalo\" , \"Rochester\" )), MD = data.frame ( state = c ( \"MD\" , \"MD\" , \"MD\" ), city = c ( \"Baltimore\" , \"Annapolis\" , \"Ocean City\" )) ) combined <- data.frame ( Reduce ( rbind , state_data )) Filter \u2691 The Filter function does basically what it sounds like \u2014 it applies a filter to a vector, list, or data frame (which is actually a type of list). It takes two main inputs, a function that applies the filter, and the object for which the filter applies. Here\u2019s a simple example: test <- 1 : 10 less_than_5 <- Filter ( function ( x ) x < 5 , test ) This, once again, creates a vector of the first 10 positive integers. The Filter function applies function(x) x < 5 to each element, x , in the vector, test . In other words, it checks each element, x , for the Boolean expression, x < 5 . If an element is not less than 5, it gets filtered out. So you might be thinking\u2026can\u2019t this be done like this? less_than_5 <- test[test < 5] \u2026and the answer is\u2026yes. It can be done that way. Filter is more useful as a function in cases involving data frames or lists. Suppose, for instance, you want to remove all constant columns from a data frame. This is something that may be done when preprocessing data prior to modeling, as a constant attribute isn\u2019t particular useful. This is can be done in one line using Filter df <- data . frame ( a = c ( 2 , 2 , 2 ), b = c ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), c = c ( 1 , 1 , 1 ), d = c ( 3 , 4 , 5 )) without_constants <- Filter ( function ( x ) length ( unique ( x )) > 1 , df ) Alternatively, using dplyr\u2019s n_distinct function, which counts the number of distinct elements in a vector, you could do this: library ( dplyr ) df <- data . frame ( a = c ( 2 , 2 , 2 ), b = c ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), c = c ( 1 , 1 , 1 ), d = c ( 3 , 4 , 5 )) without_constants <- Filter ( function ( x ) n_distinct ( x ) > 1 , df ) In the example, we create a data frame with four columns \u2014 two of them are constant. Filter tests whether there is more than one unique value in each column. If there is only one unique value, then we know the column is constant, and it gets filtered out. Each element x is a vector, or column, in the data frame. If you wanted to just drop all columns that are all NAs, you could make a minor tweak like this: df <- data.frame ( a = c ( 2 , 2 , 2 ), b = c ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), c = c ( 1 , 1 , 1 ), d = c ( NA , NA , NA )) without_nas <- Filter ( function ( x ) ! all ( is.na ( x )), df ) Filter can also be used on a regular list as well. Suppose you have a list of vectors, where some of the vectors are characters, while others are numeric. If want to filter out all of the non-numeric vectors, you could call Filter : sample_list <- list ( a = c ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), b = c ( \"is\" , \"a\" , \"character\" ), c = c ( 4 , 5 , 6 ), d = c ( \"is\" , \"another\" , \"character\" )) only_numeric <- Filter ( function ( x ) is.numeric ( x ), sample_list ) rapply \u2691 The rapply function is part of the apply family of functions in R. It has a few different uses, but one of my favorite applications for it is to apply a function to columns of a data frame that belong to a specific class, or have a particular data type. Let\u2019s say you want to get the sum of all of the numeric columns. df <- data.frame ( a = c ( 2 , 2 , 2 ), b = c ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), c = c ( \"r\" , \"is\" , \"awesome\" ), d = c ( 3 , 4 , 5 ), e = c ( \"some\" , \"other\" , \"character\" )) summed_columns <- rapply ( df , sum , class = \"numeric\" ) Similar to sapply or lapply , rapply takes a list / vector / data frame as input, along with a function to be applied. However, it can also take a \u201cclass\u201d parameter, which allows us to specify what class of object we want our function to be used for. rapply can also be used to recursively apply functions to nested lists (see examples from its documentation here ). rep \u2691 The last function I want to mention for this post is the rep function. This can be used to repeat a value as many times as you want. So if you want to create a vector of 1000 5\u2019s, it could be done like this: rep(5, 1000) Here\u2019s a couple other examples: rep(\"a\", 500) rep(\"repeat this\", 100) If you pass a vector with more than one element to rep , the entire vector gets repeated the number of times you specify. rep(c(1,2,3), 100) The above code will create a vector with 300 elements \u2014 the number of elements in c(1,2,3) times 100, repeating 1, 2, 3 over and over.

Reduce takes a list or vector as input, and reduces it down to a single element. It works by applying a function to the first two elements of the vector or list, and then applying the same function to that result with the third element. This new result gets passed with the fourth element into the function and so on until a single object remains. If the input is a vector, the result will be a single number or character. On the other hand, inputting a list can have interesting results. A list of data frames can be reduced down to a single data frame, a list of vectors can be collapsed into a matrix, and so on. A simple, though not entirely useful, example of how this works is like so: test <- 1 : 10 result <- Reduce ( sum , test ) Here, result will equal 55 , which happens to be the sum of the vector test i.e. the sum of the integers 1 through 10. Reduce solves for this by first applying the sum function to 1 and 2 (the first two elements in test). This equals 3, which then gets summed with the next element in the vector, 3. This total of 6 gets added to 4, which equals 10, and so on. The process can be seen below. $1 + 2 = 3$ $3 + 3 = 6$ $6 + 4 = 10$ $10 + 5 = 15$ $15 + 6 = 21$ $21 + 7 = 28$ $28 + 8 = 36$ $36 + 9 = 45$ $45 + 10 = 55$ Now, how about something a little more useful?

Proof of Concept code is not production code. Prototype code is, more or less, proof of concept. When you create a prototype or PoC, it\u2019s something that can be shown to the client to create a common understanding of what is to be delivered. Now, some people will disagree with this, but \u2026 after the client agrees to this prototype/PoC this code should only be saved for reference. It should only be referenced to ensure the client is getting what they received. It should be compared to the final app to make sure it works in the same order. When creating Prototype/PoC the goal is to save money. It helps set its viability, expose any technical issues and express any concern over any direction of the system. Feedback can be implemented quite easily at this point. This allows the developer and business analyst to quickly identify the noted issues without incurring a high overhead of development costs. Once the Prototype/PoC is agreed upon, the development on the prototype ceases and the design phase of the new system should begin. Under NO circumstance should the prototype be taken and converted into the actual production site. Will you take snippets of code here and there? Yes, will you grab a piece of JavaScript from the client code you created for the prototype? Yes. Will you use the entire project as your production code? No. The reason for this is simple; prototype code is ugly, messy, and nasty. It\u2019s a conglomerate of blog posts, mixed with MSDN How-To Articles , mixed with hacks and riddled with bugs.

Proof of Concept code is not production code. Prototype code is, more or less, proof of concept. When you create a prototype or PoC, it\u2019s something that can be shown to the client to create a common understanding of what is to be delivered. Now, some people will disagree with this, but \u2026 after the client agrees to this prototype/PoC this code should only be saved for reference. It should only be referenced to ensure the client is getting what they received. It should be compared to the final app to make sure it works in the same order. When creating Prototype/PoC the goal is to save money. It helps set its viability, expose any technical issues and express any concern over any direction of the system. Feedback can be implemented quite easily at this point. This allows the developer and business analyst to quickly identify the noted issues without incurring a high overhead of development costs. Once the Prototype/PoC is agreed upon, the development on the prototype ceases and the design phase of the new system should begin. Under NO circumstance should the prototype be taken and converted into the actual production site. Will you take snippets of code here and there? Yes, will you grab a piece of JavaScript from the client code you created for the prototype? Yes. Will you use the entire project as your production code? No. The reason for this is simple; prototype code is ugly, messy, and nasty. It\u2019s a conglomerate of blog posts, mixed with MSDN How-To Articles , mixed with hacks and riddled with bugs.

Also, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 index the entire contents of files, regardless of their size. To reduce the Windows search index database size, index less content. Another option to reduce the size of Windows.edb is to compact or defrag the file using esentutl.exe 1 .

Compaction of the Windows.edb database has reduced the size to 200 MB from 310 MB on my computer \u2014 ~30% savings. Resetting the Search index, or removing unwanted folder locations from the search index, and compacting the database would certainly improve the search performance in your system.

Use -f to specify name and path of one or more Compose files \u2691 Use the -f flag to specify the location of a Compose configuration file. Specifying multiple Compose files \u2691 You can supply multiple -f configuration files. When you supply multiple files, Compose combines them into a single configuration. Compose builds the configuration in the order you supply the files. Subsequent files override and add to their predecessors. For example, consider this command line: $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.admin.yml run backup_db The docker-compose.yml file might specify a webapp service. webapp : image : examples / web ports : - \"8000:8000\" volumes : - \"/data\" If the docker-compose.admin.yml also specifies this same service, any matching fields override the previous file. New values, add to the webapp service configuration. webapp : build : . environment : - DEBUG = 1 When you use multiple Compose files, all paths in the files are relative to the first configuration file specified with -f . You can use the --project-directory option to override this base path. Use a -f with - (dash) as the filename to read the configuration from stdin . When stdin is used all paths in the configuration are relative to the current working directory. The -f flag is optional. If you don\u2019t provide this flag on the command line, Compose traverses the working directory and its parent directories looking for a docker-compose.yml and a docker-compose.override.yml file. You must supply at least the docker-compose.yml file. If both files are present on the same directory level, Compose combines the two files into a single configuration. The configuration in the docker-compose.override.yml file is applied over and in addition to the values in the docker-compose.yml file. Specifying a path to a single Compose file \u2691 You can use the -f flag to specify a path to a Compose file that is not located in the current directory, either from the command line or by setting up a COMPOSE_FILE environment variable in your shell or in an environment file. For an example of using the -f option at the command line, suppose you are running the Compose Rails sample , and have a docker-compose.yml file in a directory called sandbox/rails . You can use a command like docker-compose pull to get the postgres image for the db service from anywhere by using the -f flag as follows: docker-compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/docker-compose.yml pull db Here\u2019s the full example: $ docker - compose - f ~/ sandbox / rails / docker - compose . yml pull db Pulling db ( postgres : latest ) ... latest : Pulling from library / postgres ef0380f84d05 : Pull complete 50 cf91dc1db8 : Pull complete d3add4cd115c : Pull complete 467830 d8a616 : Pull complete 089 b9db7dc57 : Pull complete 6 fba0a36935c : Pull complete 81 ef0e73c953 : Pull complete 338 a6c4894dc : Pull complete 15853 f32f67c : Pull complete 044 c83d92898 : Pull complete 17301519 f133 : Pull complete dcca70822752 : Pull complete cecf11b8ccf3 : Pull complete Digest : sha256 : 1364924 c753d5ff7e2260cd34dc4ba05ebd40ee8193391220be0f9901d4e1651 Status : Downloaded newer image for postgres : latest Use -p to specify a project name \u2691 Each configuration has a project name. If you supply a -p flag, you can specify a project name. If you don\u2019t specify the flag, Compose uses the current directory name. See also the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable . Use --profile to specify one or more active profiles \u2691 Calling docker-compose --profile frontend up will start the services with the profile frontend and services without specified profiles. You can also enable multiple profiles, e.g. with docker-compose --profile frontend --profile debug up the profiles frontend and debug will be enabled. See also Using profiles with Compose and the COMPOSE_PROFILES environment variable . Set up environment variables \u2691 You can set environment variables for various docker-compose options, including the -f and -p flags.

This post should help clarify why I\u2019m bullish on Flutter. Build the iOS and Android App at the Same Time \u2691 There are many reasons why I feel that Flutter might have a chance of succeeding in the long run, but one of the big ones is that with Flutter you can write the app once and run it on both iOS and Android. I\u2019m sure everyone is thinking \u2026 \u201cwell you can already do that with X\u201d. You\u2019re right, you can build an app with [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/React Native.md]], [[Kotlin]] Multi-Platform/Native, [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/Xamarin.md]] and as a [[Progressive Web App (PWA)]]. I\u2019ll talk about each of this later in this article, but first let\u2019s talk about Flutter. Current Problem: Two Apps, Two Teams and Duplicate Code \u2691 During my tenure as a mobile developer there\u2019s always been two apps, and two teams (or individuals) managing these apps. One team for for iOS and one team for Android. We wrote the same exact app, but in different languages for different platforms . Kind of normal right? Most people are thinking \u201cyeah, so what \u2026 and the problem is?\u201d Businesses are paying for the same app to be written twice. When you read that sentence a loud, it sounds crazy. That\u2019s exactly what CEO\u2019s/_Businesses Owners/_VP\u2019s/etc think. Who in their right mind would want to spend twice the amount of money to ship two apps that do the exact same thing but for different platforms? Shouldn\u2019t we be able to write an app once and have it work on both platforms? Immediately some of you reading this are thinking .. well.. uh NO \u2013 that\u2019s not possible. Of course it has to be written twice \u2013 once for iOS and once for Android. Well \u2026 not really, we don\u2019t have to follow that same line of thinking \u2026 let\u2019s dive in. A Brief History of Write Once for Mobile Take a look at app history and you\u2019ll notice that there have been apps written to target both platforms for years. A prime example: Most games are written to target both platforms. This is why the widgets (buttons, text boxes, etc) never look like system widgets in games. Widgets in games use their own custom built ui-widgets \u2013 giving them a style all their own, custom to the game (or app). Not sure what I\u2019m talking about? Go open a popular game and look at the buttons. They\u2019re not native looking buttons you\u2019d see in Android. Very often they\u2019re some custom thing that is part of the game. Go look at that same button on the other platform (if you\u2019re on iOS go to Android and vice versa) \u2013 you\u2019ll notice that the button is exactly the same (in most cases \u2013 there are caveats to everything). So how are game companies accomplishing this but not us day-to-day app devs? These game companies are usually coding very close to the metal \u2013 using C as their language. They compile to the platform of their choosing (iOS or Android) and such. They draw directly to the canvas and they do not use system widgets (gaming sdk\u2019s aside \u2013 e.g. \u2013 Google Play Games, etc). In other words \u2026 They\u2019re drawing all of their own UI. They have their own UI tool kit that they use to render a button, a text box, a dropdown, etc. This UI tool kit is written by them very often and is compiled as part of the game \u2013 it\u2019s not part of the Android or iOS platform. We as productive app developers don\u2019t have that luxury, and let\u2019s be 100% real here. Being a real-deal, low-level C-programming game dev is hard, real hard. Most of us are game dev and most of us are not going to create our own UI widgets just so we can get back to handling regular use cases like \u201cadding a button and a text box to a form\u201d From a financial point of view, for a business, writing an app twice doesn\u2019t make sense. This is a big concern for businesses (large and small). Cross-Platform Options \u2691 Since the inception of the two major players in mobile (iOS and Android) various cross-platform systems have attempted to solve the problem of creating two of the same app. Below are a number of options that folks have used. PhoneGap/Cordova \u2691 This didn\u2019t really work out. PhoneGap was not performant, and just felt kind of clunky. Felt wrong from the jump. When you tapped on a button or scrolled there was noticeable lag and it was to the point where it was frustrating to the user. Integrating with existing platform components was rather painful and caused a lot of development issues. Overall the solution aways felt half baked and the user experience was never top notch. It always felt as if the app is cobbled together. I don\u2019t recommend folks going this route. If they are evaluating this route I often will point them to just using. A PWA (Progressive Web App). React Native \u2691 [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/React Native.md]] get\u2019s us really close but it still falls a bit short \u2026 We still have this weird latency issue (sometimes), and a Javascript.md bridge we that we have to deal with on both platforms if we need to get into lower level stuff. We are using the native UI widgets under the hood (sorta), so we do get the true \u201cnative\u201d feel which is nice. Ultimately, we\u2019re still running JS which call into native Android widgets and iOS widgets via a JavaScript bridge. With React Native we\u2019re not running a custom UI, we\u2019re writing JavaScript that gets mapped to native OS calls. This does have a small performance penalty. It \u201ckinda\u201d feels right, but still feels kind of wrong \u2013 however it\u2019s a great step and in my opinion has a lot of potential as technology improves. Don\u2019t underestimate the JavaScript community, it is HUGE and powerful. The problem I found here though (other than the bridge) is that I had to learn both platforms, in and out to really be effective at it when I needed to integrate platform specific things (this is normally where cross platform apps fall down anyway). This is not something that is unique to my experience either. Gabriel Peal worked at AirBnb where they had a large React Native installation and he shared similar sentiments in his detailed blog post about how they migrated away from React Native. Another thing that I found difficult was testing on React Native. It was \u201cok\u201d, but I still felt I was being lied to in regards to the tests. Was I testing React Native? Or was I testing the app? Sometimes tests passed, but the UI didn\u2019t work on a device. So my skepticism meter shot up. I\u2019m sure there was something I was missing, but this goes back to having to know both platforms and the intricacies of both in order to get the bits to align properly. All that aside, I still feel rather positive about React Native and my thoughts are: If you don\u2019t need to dive into the lower internals of an OS, and your app is 100% React Native, you can do some amazing stuff with it and it\u2019s still a contender in that area Great apps for this are LOB apps (Line of Business), simple forms over data, etc. You definitely would not want to build anything super complex with it as I could see it becoming rather iffy quickly. I\u2019ve consulted with a few companies who have went really deep with React Native to run into problems when their apps were large. At that point they either had to re-write part of the their stack to be more native or had to re-evaluate certain pieces of their app. As usual, it\u2019s all about tradeoffs. Xamarin [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/Xamarin.md]] works amazingly well, the problem here is that while I was able to achieve feature parity with Xamarin I felt that I had to learn both platforms due to the design nature of both platforms. This was rather painful. I was able to share 80% of the code, but the last 20% made it almost unbearable as I was having to learn both platforms again to create the UI. Learning both platforms is a show-stopper. I want to write the app once and be done with it. That said, this technology is quite viable if your team is a [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/DotNet Framework.md]] based team and you need an app that is not a game. I know many companies in the mid-west who use Xamarin to their success. [[Microsoft]] has done a great job of supporting this tool over the years. This, with Xamarin Forms, makes it super easy to build and ship a cross-platform app, that \u201cjust works\u201d. However, for me, I can\u2019t rely on it as I need to know .NET, iOS and Android systems and widgets. Under the hood these things map to existing widgets and while you can get featured parity quickly, you do have to maintain two platforms at some level and know the intricacies of each. Kotlin Multiplatform / Native \u2691 I love [[Kotlin]]. In fact, I can\u2019t imagine writing another Android only app in Java ever again. However, I don\u2019t think Kotlin native is where it\u2019s at. I feel that Kotlin native is a distraction and many industry leaders are talking about how great it is and without a doubt it is a great technical feat \u2026 but \u2026 here\u2019s where it falls down \u2026 It\u2019s a JVM based language. Convincing iOS developers or anyone else that they need to learn Kotlin to write a cross platform app is simply not going to happen. Sure, some folks will follow suit, but the movement will be small. For example, most non-Android devs that I know will just stop right at \u201cInstall JDK\u201d. Most of those people are already thinking \u201cNOPE, no thanks.\u201d. Yes, I know that other Multiplatform tools require the same, but I\u2019m trying to illustrate a point here. I know this is hard to hear, but this is the reality out there. Java and the JVM, while still popular is not the shining knight most people want it to be. It\u2019s more like some clunky armor that works. Kotlin just happens to be the new and improved armor that works 10x better and as some nice aesthetics. However, I still have to go through the pain of getting the armor on before I can use it. In other words, you\u2019re going to peel Swift away from a iOS developers cold dead hands. Convincing them to move to Kotlin, while possible, is something I\u2019ve tried and it doesn\u2019t work that well. It\u2019s a pipe dream. I feel that Kotlin Multiplatform and Kotlin to JavaScript are cool pieces of tech, but the user adoption might not be there. JavaScript already has a huge jump start on Kotlin in regards to adoption, but ultimately we get back to the same argument \u2013 what one person loves the other person hates. It is what it is. PWA \u2013 Progressive Web Apps \u2691 This one is interesting because I\u2019m in a very small camp of people who believe that the web will win one day. It\u2019s the ultimate platform. I do feel that one day we\u2019ll see that there are a handful of super useful native apps (Navigation, Games, Entertainment, systems control, etc) but for the most part everything else will be web based. This is where PWA\u2019s come in. I\u2019ve seen some really good PWA\u2019s in the last few years. The problem here is that it\u2019s not a \u201cnative\u201d app and you have to put a wrapper around it. That just feels clunky. People want \u201can app\u201d. Actually they don\u2019t want an \u201capp\u201d. They want an \u201cicon\u201d they can tap on, one they can search for on the App Store. I don\u2019t think were here yet, for PWA\u2019s \u2026 BUT \u2026. I will say this \u2026 when I consult companies for mobile apps and they ask me for a quote, more often than not I\u2019ll end up talking them out of an app. Why? Because they don\u2019t need one. Someone can go to a link and get a super fast loading HTML web app that does everything they need. I usually tell them \u201cthis is v1\u201d, if you need XYZ later, then we can look at an app. The we get to that point though, I\u2019ll usually look cross platform as most companies do not need to write a game/etc. Will Any of These Technologies Actually Work? \u2691 In the right situation, yes. They will work. However, I don\u2019t think any of these are truly revolutionary. React Native and Xamarin really helped spearhead what some of the possibilities were like, but ultimately it felt like we were still writing two apps and debugging two platforms/etc. As much hype as Kotlin Multiplatform is getting in the Android world, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s that popular. In the last few weeks I\u2019ve spoken to close to a hundred devs and none of them have heard of Kotlin Multiplatform unless they were an Android dev. Kotlin Multiplatform is cool, but thats where it stops currently. Maybe that will change \u2013 only time will tell. That\u2019s just my .02 and I know its not a popular one \u2013 especially since the majority of the work I do is in the Kotlin and JVM camp right now. When coming to this conclusion I did my best to step out of my own field of influence and observe things from alternative perspectives. I\u2019ve talked to people in all of these areas \u2013 React Native, Xamarin, Kotlin Multiplatform and then day-to-day iOS devs. The short of it is \u2026 people grow attachments to their tools. It\u2019s hard to get people to change. Developers are optimistic by nature and due to that optimism our outlook is often shaded with a lens that is not often the reality that we live in. Here\u2019s the thing \u2013 all of these cross platform technologies suffer from a similar problem \u2013 we\u2019re using an existing language and/or platform that you\u2019re already familiar with to create a cross-platform app. This works well if you already write JavaScript, or .NET or Kotlin, but if you don\u2019t \u2026 well\u2026 good luck with convincing others to try it. Habits are hard to break, especially when they\u2019re not yours. \u2026 and this is where Dart and Flutter come in to play \u2026 Why Flutter Might Work \u2691 When I first heard of Flutter I was bearish on it. I\u2019ve seen so many of these cross-platform technologies that I figured it was another fly by night type of tech that was nothing to write home about. That changed when Kaushik Gopal (@kaushikgopal) and I talked to Eugenio Marletti (@workingkills) on the Fragmented Podcast about his experience with Flutter ( Part 1 and Part 2 ). I learned in that conversation what the power of Flutter really was and how, if executed properly, it could become a powerhouse in the industry. The Flutter Developer Experience \u2691 Before I hop into the full developer experience I want to cover a brief history of Android and some of the things that have made developing for Android not as enjoyable as it could have been \u2026 One of the things that is frustrating about Android development is that the system was not built with testing in mind. This makes testing very frustrating. I don\u2019t blame the engineers at Android for this. Android was a small company before Google bought them and brought them in house. In fact, Android was originally built to be a Camera operating system. Read that again and let it sink in for a second. Android was a small company before Google acquired them and the first lines of Android code were written in 2003. Yes. It\u2019s that old. Google didn\u2019t buy the company until 2005. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re painting a picture in your mind that helps illustrate why things are the way they are in Android \u2026 in short \u2013 its old and complicated. Android started with a foundation back in 2003 that was not conducive to testing especially in a camera operating sense of the world. Fast forward to current day and we have Kotlin and many tools and frameworks to help us with testing, but thats what they do \u2026 they help. If you dive deep into these libraries you see there\u2019s a lot of magic that\u2019s happening to help combat the problem of dealing with a large legacy codebase like Android. Lots of retries, lots of special cases all over the place. I\u2019m grateful for the libraries, but it doesn\u2019t fix the root cause that we have a huge complicated legacy beast on our hands (Android itself). I commend the Android team(s) at Google for helping make things better, but lets say it like it is \u2026 Android is a pig with lipstick. Albeit, its a great pig with lipstick. I favor Android over iOS any day, but \u2026 it\u2019s easy to see why things are now rather brittle. Which brings me back to experience \u2026 I\u2019ve been developing android apps for nearly 11 years now. I started with v1 and I\u2019m still here. Things have gotten a lot better, but there is s still a huge level of frustration with day to day development and that experience is a real downer. I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019ve often thought about throwing in the towel on Android development because of the frustration level of it. Before you say \u201cWell Donn, you must have been working on the wrong apps, or the apps were built incorrectly.\u201d Possibly. Maybe. I\u2019m a consultant. I see some amazingly built apps and I see some real piles of shit. It\u2019s a mixed bag. I do my best to fix things, but at the end of the day there\u2019s only so much budget to go around. Back to developer experience \u2026 I read the following quote somewhere, but I cannot find it (if you do find the source, let me know and I\u2019ll link it): Ruby on Rails is a joy to work with. Wait, what? Android, now Rails? Where are you going with this, Donn? Hang in there, trust me, it\u2019s going somewhere \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing Rails development for many years now and I completely agree. Working with Rails is a joy. The ruby language is fantastic and I find myself enjoying working on Rails projects. I can express my intent easily and I find it fun (I also feel this way about the Kotlin language, but not the Android framework, in particular). Flutter is the first tech that I\u2019ve worked with in mobile where I truly enjoyed the development experience. You\u2019re using very \u201cReact like\u201d programming models (mutating state, uni-directional data flow, etc). My previous 10-11 years have been spent in antiquated Android development, and to be 100% honest, it\u2019s been fun, but also very frustrating. When I wrote my first Flutter app I was thoroughly impressed with what I was able to do. I had worked with React before so some of the concepts moved over easily for me. It simply made sense. State management, building the UI with components in code, a reactive like architecture. It simply felt right. One of the real deal things that got me interested in Flutter was testing support. It\u2019s baked in. Very rails-esque if you ask me. I did run into some areas that were confusing during development, but thats normal during any exploration of any new tech. I was able to resolve them easily \u2013 same could be said of any of the other platforms too. It\u2019s just part of the learning experience. Overall, I found the experience of setting up a new project easy, fast and I was able to hop in real quick and be productive (after I grokked the system). The Dart Programming Language \u2691 Flutter apps are written in [[Dart]]. I like Dart. That said, I\u2019m not a raving fan of it either. I think Matt Sullivan put it best in one of his talks (sorry can\u2019t find the link) \u2026 and this is paraphrased \u2026 \u201cDart is kind of a mundane language. It\u2019s great at its job, but it\u2019s nothing to rave about. In fact, some might find it boring, but that probably works in its favor as its easy to understand and apply. I totally agree with that. I first wrote dart back in 2012 at Google IO in a code lab. It felt very \u201cJavaScripty\u201d. In fact, Dart is an ECMA standard, so you\u2019ll find a lot of similarity between Dart and JavaScript. Learning Dart is fairly easy and if you have any experience with any C style language you\u2019ll pick it up quickly. Why Dart though? As mentioned earlier \u2013 it\u2019s hard to peel tools away from existing developers hands. If they like Swift and you tell them to write Kotlin, well \u2026 that\u2019s going to be an interesting kerfuffle. The Flutter team chose Dart for many reasons, as outlined in this article: Why Flutter Uses Dart \u2013 Hacker Noon and I think one of the huge benefits of using Dart is having a \u201cnewish\u201d language to support a new cross platform technology. I can\u2019t come to Flutter and be encumbered by previous notions of how I think Dart sucks or Dart this or Dart that. Why? Most likely I\u2019ve not used Dart. I fact, I\u2019ve never met a dev who has used it outside of Flutter, yet. I know they exist, but they\u2019re rare. This opens a door that was previously closed. Now, as a developer, I have the opportunity to learn a new framework for cross platform development and I\u2019m not inhibited by a previous experience with a given language. Its a new landscape that I\u2019m embarking on and that for a developer is a very freeing feeling. It\u2019s almost like a painter who is given a new set of brushes they\u2019ve never used before on a canvas of a type they\u2019ve never used before with a paint type they\u2019ve never used before. Sure, they may be a great painter, but now they get to explore and see what they can do with these new tools. They see it as a playground. The same thing happens when you start with with Flutter. It\u2019s a new playground. You\u2019ll find that you can/can\u2019t do X with Dart or that you hav etc do it a different way. Like it or not, you\u2019re learning and growing and that\u2019s a good feeling as a developer. Overall, Dart was a great choice and I think it has helped the adoption of the platform more than what most people give it credit for. No More Native Widgets \u2691 I\u2019m going to dumb this down a bit, but in short \u2013 Flutter doesn\u2019t call out to the Android UI toolkit. It does not call the EditText or TextView or anything like that. Flutter draws directly to a canvas (basically) and does not interact with existing iOS or Android widgets. Just like a game would \u2013 it\u2019s drawing everything. You might be wondering how this is done \u2026 kind of magic, right? It looks like regular Android and iOS buttons \u2026 This is done with Dart at the higher level (where they recreate the widgets themselves or with a theme they create) and then render them to the screen with with Skia (C++), Dart and some Text components directly to the canvas. What this means is that Flutter controls the entire drawing of the widget. So they can say a button \u201clooks like this\u201d and a text box \u201clooks like this\u201d and they can (and do) make them look the same on each platform. This also allows for the Flutter team to deterministically add platform specific features to each widget. For example, a list view item in Android would simply be a list item. In iOS it might have a chevron on the right hand side. Many things like this are managed by Flutter. Just like a game, all the rendering is handled via Flutter. This can be seen as a risk because of being out of date with the platform during upgrades, but if you\u2019re using the basic components that are provided by Flutter it\u2019s a no brainer. They also do a great job of keeping up with the changes. Flutter Makes Design Easier (if you allow it) \u2691 As a developer one of the things I like to do is ship often. What deters this from happening is a good design language. Back when I was a web developer full time I was ecstatic when Twitter Bootstrap was released for the web. I could easily build great looking sites with minimal effort as long as I use this design framework. It was great. We needed something like this for Android and other platforms. Material design enabled this to happen. Unfortunately, you had to often build your own widgets for Android and iOS (though that has changed recently with some of the design support libraries). When building a Flutter app I prefer to use the Material Design Theme out of the box to build something. What the Flutter team has done is recreate the Material Design widgets for both platforms. So I will get a toolbar, buttons, inputs and text that looks and acts as it should for both Android and iOS, all without me having to do anything other than saying I need a Button here, and some text there, etc. Flutter renders it correctly on both platforms and it looks great. This is huge. Testing \u2691 I don\u2019t have to rely on Espresso for Android and whatever tool is used for iOS. That in itself is huge. Testing is built in from the ground up. You can have one of the following three test types: Unit Test: tests a single function, method or class Widget Test: Tests a single widget (known as a component in other UI frameworks typically) Integration Tests: Test a complete app or a feature of an app. You can easily set up your tests and write code with confidence quickly. To me, this is a HUGE win and something that attracts me to the platform. Greenfield vs Brownfield \u2691 As with anything there are some pitfalls with new tech. One such thing is Greenfield vs Brownfield development. Let\u2019s quickly define the terms: Greenfield: Brand new app development Brownfield: Existing app development, adding features_changes_etc At the time of this writing, Flutter is great for Greenfield development where the entire app is in Flutter. The same can not be said of the opposite. Brownfield Flutter apps are not possible at this time and the Flutter team is currently working on a solution . I\u2019m not sure its good to mix the two though. This creates problems later down the road as the platform zealots of each team (Android and iOS) want to rip out the Flutter stuff, while the Flutter devs want more of the app to be Flutter. I had his same experience with React Native and brownfield development. Native devs wanted it gone. React devs wanted more React. Both have their preference. When an app is build Greenfield with Flutter, the team embraces the tech and makes it work. If you\u2019re thinking about Flutter, I advise building an app from the ground up with Flutter or recreating another simple app you have with Flutter. Skepticism \u2691 With each new piece of tech some high level of skepticism is bound to follow. Flutter is not immune to this. Some common concerns I see is: It\u2019s a Google product, they could kill it tomorrow. Dart will never be mainstream, it\u2019s also a Google product that could be killed I can\u2019t do xyz with it. Listen, Flutter is not a silver bullet, but it\u2019s something that should be evaluated. Imagine fixing a bug ONCE and it\u2019s fixed on both platforms. Kind of reminds me of the web days. Fix it once and it\u2019s fixed for everyone. That would be fantastic and businesses drool over this idea. You know how much money could be saved? Productivity increase? This is why things like React Native and Xamarin have gained traction. I do have my share of skepticism though too. I feel that Flutter is a fantastic cross platform tech for Android and iOS. The Flutter team has recently announced Hummingbird \u2013 Flutter for the Web. This is where I come to a hard stop. I feel that HTML/CSS/JS are the web and thats what belongs there. They\u2019ve been the incumbent since the inception of the web. They\u2019ve been improved and this has not strayed. We\u2019ve tried other cross platform tech on the web before and it\u2019s always failed. We tried Java Applets, we tried Active-X, we tried Flash, we tried Silverlight, etc. All were killed and dominated by HTML/CSS/JS. The closest was Flash, but web now how that panned out. I know that Hummingbird is going to compile down to some form of HTML and CSS with canvas rendering, which is exactly what its doing (canvas drawing) in Android/iOS. So\u2026 this might have some legs \u2026 I\u2019m not sure though. This is a bit iffy for me right now and I\u2019m going to stand on the sidelines and see how it unfolds. I\u2019m not confident it will work out, its such a huge jump from mobile web, that it\u2019s hard to fathom what and now how that would work efficiently for performance and for development and debugging. This is also why I\u2019ve also felt that web will win one day. Our devices will get fast enough, the networks will have enough capacity and HTML/JS integration will become so good with the mobile devices that we will end up writing everything as a PWA/Web App of some sort. When will that happen, I\u2019m not sure. We\u2019re definitely not there yet. However, watch Google IO and look at the sessions. You\u2019ll see there are always a good amount of Web and PWA talks. For good reason, Google see\u2019s it too. In fact, if we can get everything over to the web, things are easier for everyone. Easier to build for, easier to manage, though there is some skepticism about app stores/etc. I think those will go away one day too, we\u2019ll see though\u2026 The Flutter Community \u2691 This last point is one worth bellowing from a rooftop. Without a community any piece of tech will fail. Flutter has a raving community of fans. I\u2019m in that camp. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s raving and great because I\u2019m in it either. It\u2019s not confirmation bias at work, not at all. Look at all of the meetups, the blogs, the videos, podcasts, conference talks, etc. Flutter has gained a lot of momentum. Whilst not covered here in detail \u2013 there is a significant open source movement with Dart packages that can be used on Flutter. Explore them here: Dart packages You can find a ton of packages to do all kinds of stuff that you need to do. All built, supported and used by the community at large. It sort of reminds me of the early Node.js days with NPM and early Rails and rubygems days. Exciting times. Try It, You\u2019ll Probably Like It \u2691 Flutter a new way to write cross platform apps that is not encumbered by previous technologies. It allows us to write apps that target both platforms with ease. It gives you a new programming language and paradigm (uni-directional data) to learn and follow. When you\u2019re done compiling you\u2019re left with two files \u2013 one for Android and one for iOS and they look, and act like iOS and Android apps respectively \u2013 all the way down to how a list bounces when you hit the end of it (it varies per platform).

One team for for iOS and one team for Android. We wrote the same exact app, but in different languages for different platforms . Kind of normal right? Most people are thinking \u201cyeah, so what \u2026 and the problem is?\u201d Businesses are paying for the same app to be written twice. When you read that sentence a loud, it sounds crazy. That\u2019s exactly what CEO\u2019s/_Businesses Owners/_VP\u2019s/etc think. Who in their right mind would want to spend twice the amount of money to ship two apps that do the exact same thing but for different platforms? Shouldn\u2019t we be able to write an app once and have it work on both platforms? Immediately some of you reading this are thinking .. well.. uh NO \u2013 that\u2019s not possible. Of course it has to be written twice \u2013 once for iOS and once for Android. Well \u2026 not really, we don\u2019t have to follow that same line of thinking \u2026 let\u2019s dive in. A Brief History of Write Once for Mobile Take a look at app history and you\u2019ll notice that there have been apps written to target both platforms for years. A prime example: Most games are written to target both platforms. This is why the widgets (buttons, text boxes, etc) never look like system widgets in games. Widgets in games use their own custom built ui-widgets \u2013 giving them a style all their own, custom to the game (or app). Not sure what I\u2019m talking about? Go open a popular game and look at the buttons. They\u2019re not native looking buttons you\u2019d see in Android. Very often they\u2019re some custom thing that is part of the game. Go look at that same button on the other platform (if you\u2019re on iOS go to Android and vice versa) \u2013 you\u2019ll notice that the button is exactly the same (in most cases \u2013 there are caveats to everything). So how are game companies accomplishing this but not us day-to-day app devs? These game companies are usually coding very close to the metal \u2013 using C as their language. They compile to the platform of their choosing (iOS or Android) and such. They draw directly to the canvas and they do not use system widgets (gaming sdk\u2019s aside \u2013 e.g. \u2013 Google Play Games, etc). In other words \u2026 They\u2019re drawing all of their own UI. They have their own UI tool kit that they use to render a button, a text box, a dropdown, etc. This UI tool kit is written by them very often and is compiled as part of the game \u2013 it\u2019s not part of the Android or iOS platform. We as productive app developers don\u2019t have that luxury, and let\u2019s be 100% real here. Being a real-deal, low-level C-programming game dev is hard, real hard. Most of us are game dev and most of us are not going to create our own UI widgets just so we can get back to handling regular use cases like \u201cadding a button and a text box to a form\u201d From a financial point of view, for a business, writing an app twice doesn\u2019t make sense.

We are using the native UI widgets under the hood (sorta), so we do get the true \u201cnative\u201d feel which is nice. Ultimately, we\u2019re still running JS which call into native Android widgets and iOS widgets via a JavaScript bridge. With React Native we\u2019re not running a custom UI, we\u2019re writing JavaScript that gets mapped to native OS calls. This does have a small performance penalty. It \u201ckinda\u201d feels right, but still feels kind of wrong \u2013 however it\u2019s a great step and in my opinion has a lot of potential as technology improves. Don\u2019t underestimate the JavaScript community, it is HUGE and powerful. The problem I found here though (other than the bridge) is that I had to learn both platforms, in and out to really be effective at it when I needed to integrate platform specific things (this is normally where cross platform apps fall down anyway). This is not something that is unique to my experience either. Gabriel Peal worked at AirBnb where they had a large React Native installation and he shared similar sentiments in his detailed blog post about how they migrated away from React Native. Another thing that I found difficult was testing on React Native. It was \u201cok\u201d, but I still felt I was being lied to in regards to the tests. Was I testing React Native? Or was I testing the app? Sometimes tests passed, but the UI didn\u2019t work on a device. So my skepticism meter shot up. I\u2019m sure there was something I was missing, but this goes back to having to know both platforms and the intricacies of both in order to get the bits to align properly. All that aside, I still feel rather positive about React Native and my thoughts are: If you don\u2019t need to dive into the lower internals of an OS, and your app is 100% React Native, you can do some amazing stuff with it and it\u2019s still a contender in that area Great apps for this are LOB apps (Line of Business), simple forms over data, etc. You definitely would not want to build anything super complex with it as I could see it becoming rather iffy quickly. I\u2019ve consulted with a few companies who have went really deep with React Native to run into problems when their apps were large. At that point they either had to re-write part of the their stack to be more native or had to re-evaluate certain pieces of their app. As usual, it\u2019s all about tradeoffs. Xamarin [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/Xamarin.md]] works amazingly well, the problem here is that while I was able to achieve feature parity with Xamarin I felt that I had to learn both platforms due to the design nature of both platforms. This was rather painful. I was able to share 80% of the code, but the last 20% made it almost unbearable as I was having to learn both platforms again to create the UI. Learning both platforms is a show-stopper. I want to write the app once and be done with it. That said, this technology is quite viable if your team is a [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/DotNet Framework.md]] based team and you need an app that is not a game. I know many companies in the mid-west who use Xamarin to their success. [[Microsoft]] has done a great job of supporting this tool over the years. This, with Xamarin Forms, makes it super easy to build and ship a cross-platform app, that \u201cjust works\u201d. However, for me, I can\u2019t rely on it as I need to know .NET, iOS and Android systems and widgets. Under the hood these things map to existing widgets and while you can get featured parity quickly, you do have to maintain two platforms at some level and know the intricacies of each.","title":"React Native"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Flutter/#kotlin-multiplatform-native","text":"I love [[Kotlin]]. In fact, I can\u2019t imagine writing another Android only app in Java ever again. However, I don\u2019t think Kotlin native is where it\u2019s at.

Convincing iOS developers or anyone else that they need to learn Kotlin to write a cross platform app is simply not going to happen. Sure, some folks will follow suit, but the movement will be small. For example, most non-Android devs that I know will just stop right at \u201cInstall JDK\u201d. Most of those people are already thinking \u201cNOPE, no thanks.\u201d. Yes, I know that other Multiplatform tools require the same, but I\u2019m trying to illustrate a point here. I know this is hard to hear, but this is the reality out there. Java and the JVM, while still popular is not the shining knight most people want it to be. It\u2019s more like some clunky armor that works. Kotlin just happens to be the new and improved armor that works 10x better and as some nice aesthetics. However, I still have to go through the pain of getting the armor on before I can use it. In other words, you\u2019re going to peel Swift away from a iOS developers cold dead hands. Convincing them to move to Kotlin, while possible, is something I\u2019ve tried and it doesn\u2019t work that well. It\u2019s a pipe dream. I feel that Kotlin Multiplatform and Kotlin to JavaScript are cool pieces of tech, but the user adoption might not be there.

This makes testing very frustrating. I don\u2019t blame the engineers at Android for this. Android was a small company before Google bought them and brought them in house. In fact, Android was originally built to be a Camera operating system. Read that again and let it sink in for a second. Android was a small company before Google acquired them and the first lines of Android code were written in 2003. Yes. It\u2019s that old. Google didn\u2019t buy the company until 2005. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re painting a picture in your mind that helps illustrate why things are the way they are in Android \u2026 in short \u2013 its old and complicated. Android started with a foundation back in 2003 that was not conducive to testing especially in a camera operating sense of the world. Fast forward to current day and we have Kotlin and many tools and frameworks to help us with testing, but thats what they do \u2026 they help. If you dive deep into these libraries you see there\u2019s a lot of magic that\u2019s happening to help combat the problem of dealing with a large legacy codebase like Android. Lots of retries, lots of special cases all over the place. I\u2019m grateful for the libraries, but it doesn\u2019t fix the root cause that we have a huge complicated legacy beast on our hands (Android itself). I commend the Android team(s) at Google for helping make things better, but lets say it like it is \u2026 Android is a pig with lipstick. Albeit, its a great pig with lipstick. I favor Android over iOS any day, but \u2026 it\u2019s easy to see why things are now rather brittle. Which brings me back to experience \u2026 I\u2019ve been developing android apps for nearly 11 years now. I started with v1 and I\u2019m still here. Things have gotten a lot better, but there is s still a huge level of frustration with day to day development and that experience is a real downer. I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019ve often thought about throwing in the towel on Android development because of the frustration level of it. Before you say \u201cWell Donn, you must have been working on the wrong apps, or the apps were built incorrectly.\u201d Possibly. Maybe. I\u2019m a consultant. I see some amazingly built apps and I see some real piles of shit. It\u2019s a mixed bag. I do my best to fix things, but at the end of the day there\u2019s only so much budget to go around. Back to developer experience \u2026 I read the following quote somewhere, but I cannot find it (if you do find the source, let me know and I\u2019ll link it): Ruby on Rails is a joy to work with. Wait, what? Android, now Rails? Where are you going with this, Donn? Hang in there, trust me, it\u2019s going somewhere \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing Rails development for many years now and I completely agree. Working with Rails is a joy. The ruby language is fantastic and I find myself enjoying working on Rails projects. I can express my intent easily and I find it fun (I also feel this way about the Kotlin language, but not the Android framework, in particular). Flutter is the first tech that I\u2019ve worked with in mobile where I truly enjoyed the development experience. You\u2019re using very \u201cReact like\u201d programming models (mutating state, uni-directional data flow, etc). My previous 10-11 years have been spent in antiquated Android development, and to be 100% honest, it\u2019s been fun, but also very frustrating. When I wrote my first Flutter app I was thoroughly impressed with what I was able to do. I had worked with React before so some of the concepts moved over easily for me. It simply made sense. State management, building the UI with components in code, a reactive like architecture. It simply felt right. One of the real deal things that got me interested in Flutter was testing support. It\u2019s baked in. Very rails-esque if you ask me. I did run into some areas that were confusing during development, but thats normal during any exploration of any new tech. I was able to resolve them easily \u2013 same could be said of any of the other platforms too. It\u2019s just part of the learning experience. Overall, I found the experience of setting up a new project easy, fast and I was able to hop in real quick and be productive (after I grokked the system).","title":"The Flutter Developer Experience"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Flutter/#the-dart-programming-language","text":"Flutter apps are written in [[Dart]]. I like Dart. That said, I\u2019m not a raving fan of it either. I think Matt Sullivan put it best in one of his talks (sorry can\u2019t find the link) \u2026 and this is paraphrased \u2026 \u201cDart is kind of a mundane language. It\u2019s great at its job, but it\u2019s nothing to rave about. In fact, some might find it boring, but that probably works in its favor as its easy to understand and apply. I totally agree with that. I first wrote dart back in 2012 at Google IO in a code lab. It felt very \u201cJavaScripty\u201d. In fact, Dart is an ECMA standard, so you\u2019ll find a lot of similarity between Dart and JavaScript. Learning Dart is fairly easy and if you have any experience with any C style language you\u2019ll pick it up quickly. Why Dart though? As mentioned earlier \u2013 it\u2019s hard to peel tools away from existing developers hands. If they like Swift and you tell them to write Kotlin, well \u2026 that\u2019s going to be an interesting kerfuffle. The Flutter team chose Dart for many reasons, as outlined in this article: Why Flutter Uses Dart \u2013 Hacker Noon and I think one of the huge benefits of using Dart is having a \u201cnewish\u201d language to support a new cross platform technology. I can\u2019t come to Flutter and be encumbered by previous notions of how I think Dart sucks or Dart this or Dart that. Why? Most likely I\u2019ve not used Dart. I fact, I\u2019ve never met a dev who has used it outside of Flutter, yet. I know they exist, but they\u2019re rare. This opens a door that was previously closed. Now, as a developer, I have the opportunity to learn a new framework for cross platform development and I\u2019m not inhibited by a previous experience with a given language. Its a new landscape that I\u2019m embarking on and that for a developer is a very freeing feeling. It\u2019s almost like a painter who is given a new set of brushes they\u2019ve never used before on a canvas of a type they\u2019ve never used before with a paint type they\u2019ve never used before. Sure, they may be a great painter, but now they get to explore and see what they can do with these new tools. They see it as a playground. The same thing happens when you start with with Flutter. It\u2019s a new playground. You\u2019ll find that you can/can\u2019t do X with Dart or that you hav etc do it a different way. Like it or not, you\u2019re learning and growing and that\u2019s a good feeling as a developer. Overall, Dart was a great choice and I think it has helped the adoption of the platform more than what most people give it credit for.","title":"The Dart Programming Language"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Flutter/#no-more-native-widgets","text":"I\u2019m going to dumb this down a bit, but in short \u2013 Flutter doesn\u2019t call out to the Android UI toolkit. It does not call the EditText or TextView or anything like that. Flutter draws directly to a canvas (basically) and does not interact with existing iOS or Android widgets. Just like a game would \u2013 it\u2019s drawing everything. You might be wondering how this is done \u2026 kind of magic, right? It looks like regular Android and iOS buttons \u2026 This is done with Dart at the higher level (where they recreate the widgets themselves or with a theme they create) and then render them to the screen with with Skia (C++), Dart and some Text components directly to the canvas. What this means is that Flutter controls the entire drawing of the widget. So they can say a button \u201clooks like this\u201d and a text box \u201clooks like this\u201d and they can (and do) make them look the same on each platform. This also allows for the Flutter team to deterministically add platform specific features to each widget. For example, a list view item in Android would simply be a list item. In iOS it might have a chevron on the right hand side. Many things like this are managed by Flutter. Just like a game, all the rendering is handled via Flutter. This can be seen as a risk because of being out of date with the platform during upgrades, but if you\u2019re using the basic components that are provided by Flutter it\u2019s a no brainer. They also do a great job of keeping up with the changes.","title":"No More Native Widgets"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Flutter/#flutter-makes-design-easier-if-you-allow-it","text":"As a developer one of the things I like to do is ship often. What deters this from happening is a good design language. Back when I was a web developer full time I was ecstatic when Twitter Bootstrap was released for the web. I could easily build great looking sites with minimal effort as long as I use this design framework. It was great. We needed something like this for Android and other platforms. Material design enabled this to happen. Unfortunately, you had to often build your own widgets for Android and iOS (though that has changed recently with some of the design support libraries). When building a Flutter app I prefer to use the Material Design Theme out of the box to build something. What the Flutter team has done is recreate the Material Design widgets for both platforms. So I will get a toolbar, buttons, inputs and text that looks and acts as it should for both Android and iOS, all without me having to do anything other than saying I need a Button here, and some text there, etc. Flutter renders it correctly on both platforms and it looks great. This is huge.","title":"Flutter Makes Design Easier (if you allow it)"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Flutter/#testing","text":"I don\u2019t have to rely on Espresso for Android and whatever tool is used for iOS. That in itself is huge. Testing is built in from the ground up. You can have one of the following three test types: Unit Test: tests a single function, method or class Widget Test: Tests a single widget (known as a component in other UI frameworks typically) Integration Tests: Test a complete app or a feature of an app. You can easily set up your tests and write code with confidence quickly. To me, this is a HUGE win and something that attracts me to the platform.","title":"Testing"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Flutter/#greenfield-vs-brownfield","text":"As with anything there are some pitfalls with new tech. One such thing is Greenfield vs Brownfield development. Let\u2019s quickly define the terms: Greenfield: Brand new app development Brownfield: Existing app development, adding features_changes_etc At the time of this writing, Flutter is great for Greenfield development where the entire app is in Flutter. The same can not be said of the opposite. Brownfield Flutter apps are not possible at this time and the Flutter team is currently working on a solution . I\u2019m not sure its good to mix the two though. This creates problems later down the road as the platform zealots of each team (Android and iOS) want to rip out the Flutter stuff, while the Flutter devs want more of the app to be Flutter. I had his same experience with React Native and brownfield development. Native devs wanted it gone. React devs wanted more React. Both have their preference. When an app is build Greenfield with Flutter, the team embraces the tech and makes it work. If you\u2019re thinking about Flutter, I advise building an app from the ground up with Flutter or recreating another simple app you have with Flutter.","title":"Greenfield vs Brownfield"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Flutter/#skepticism","text":"With each new piece of tech some high level of skepticism is bound to follow. Flutter is not immune to this. Some common concerns I see is: It\u2019s a Google product, they could kill it tomorrow. Dart will never be mainstream, it\u2019s also a Google product that could be killed I can\u2019t do xyz with it. Listen, Flutter is not a silver bullet, but it\u2019s something that should be evaluated. Imagine fixing a bug ONCE and it\u2019s fixed on both platforms. Kind of reminds me of the web days. Fix it once and it\u2019s fixed for everyone. That would be fantastic and businesses drool over this idea. You know how much money could be saved? Productivity increase? This is why things like React Native and Xamarin have gained traction. I do have my share of skepticism though too. I feel that Flutter is a fantastic cross platform tech for Android and iOS. The Flutter team has recently announced Hummingbird \u2013 Flutter for the Web. This is where I come to a hard stop. I feel that HTML/CSS/JS are the web and thats what belongs there. They\u2019ve been the incumbent since the inception of the web. They\u2019ve been improved and this has not strayed. We\u2019ve tried other cross platform tech on the web before and it\u2019s always failed. We tried Java Applets, we tried Active-X, we tried Flash, we tried Silverlight, etc. All were killed and dominated by HTML/CSS/JS. The closest was Flash, but web now how that panned out. I know that Hummingbird is going to compile down to some form of HTML and CSS with canvas rendering, which is exactly what its doing (canvas drawing) in Android/iOS. So\u2026 this might have some legs \u2026 I\u2019m not sure though. This is a bit iffy for me right now and I\u2019m going to stand on the sidelines and see how it unfolds. I\u2019m not confident it will work out, its such a huge jump from mobile web, that it\u2019s hard to fathom what and now how that would work efficiently for performance and for development and debugging. This is also why I\u2019ve also felt that web will win one day. Our devices will get fast enough, the networks will have enough capacity and HTML/JS integration will become so good with the mobile devices that we will end up writing everything as a PWA/Web App of some sort. When will that happen, I\u2019m not sure. We\u2019re definitely not there yet. However, watch Google IO and look at the sessions. You\u2019ll see there are always a good amount of Web and PWA talks. For good reason, Google see\u2019s it too. In fact, if we can get everything over to the web, things are easier for everyone. Easier to build for, easier to manage, though there is some skepticism about app stores/etc. I think those will go away one day too, we\u2019ll see though\u2026","title":"Skepticism"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Flutter/#the-flutter-community","text":"This last point is one worth bellowing from a rooftop.

It\u2019s not confirmation bias at work, not at all. Look at all of the meetups, the blogs, the videos, podcasts, conference talks, etc. Flutter has gained a lot of momentum. Whilst not covered here in detail \u2013 there is a significant open source movement with Dart packages that can be used on Flutter. Explore them here: Dart packages You can find a ton of packages to do all kinds of stuff that you need to do. All built, supported and used by the community at large.

Background: \u2691 This page is generated by a web of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, sent to you by Codecademy via the internet. The internet is made up of a bunch of resources hosted on different servers. The term \u201cresource\u201d corresponds to any entity on the web, including HTML files, stylesheets, images, videos, and scripts. To access content on the internet, your browser must ask these servers for the resources it wants, and then display these resources to you. This protocol of requests and responses enables you view this page in your browser. This article focuses on one fundamental part of how the internet functions: HTTP. What is HTTP? \u2691 HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is used to structure requests and responses over the internet. HTTP requires data to be transferred from one point to another over the network. The transfer of resources happens using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). In viewing this webpage, TCP manages the channels between your browser and the server (in this case, codecademy.com). TCP is used to manage many types of internet connections in which one computer or device wants to send something to another. HTTP is the command language that the devices on both sides of the connection must follow in order to communicate. HTTP & TCP: How it Works \u2691 When you type an address such as www.codecademy.com into your browser, you are commanding it to open a TCP channel to the server that responds to that URL (or Uniform Resource Locator, which you can read more about on Wikipedia ). A URL is like your home address or phone number because it describes how to reach you. In this situation, your computer, which is making the request, is called the client. The URL you are requesting is the address that belongs to the server. Once the TCP connection is established, the client sends a HTTP GET request to the server to retrieve the webpage it should display. After the server has sent the response, it closes the TCP connection. If you open the website in your browser again, or if your browser automatically requests something from the server, a new connection is opened which follows the same process described above. GET requests are one kind of HTTP method a client can call. You can learn more about the other common ones ( POST , PUT and DELETE ) in this article . Let\u2019s explore an example of how GET requests (the most common type of request) are used to help your computer (the client) access resources on the web. Suppose you want to check out the latest course offerings from http://codecademy.com . After you type the URL into your browser, your browser will extract the http part and recognize that it is the name of the network protocol to use. Then, it takes the domain name from the URL, in this case \u201ccodecademy.com\u201d, and asks the internet Domain Name Server to return an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Now the client knows the destination\u2019s IP address. It then opens a connection to the server at that address, using the http protocol as specified. It will initiate a GET request to the server which contains the IP address of the host and optionally a data payload. The GET request contains the following text: GET / HTTP/1.1Host: www.codecademy.com This identifies the type of request, the path on www.codecademy.com (in this case, \u201c/\u201c) and the protocol \u201cHTTP/1.1.\u201d HTTP/1.1 is a revision of the first HTTP, which is now called HTTP/1.0. In HTTP/1.0, every resource request requires a separate connection to the server. HTTP/1.1 uses one connection more than once, so that additional content (like images or stylesheets) is retrieved even after the page has been retrieved. As a result, requests using HTTP/1.1 have less delay than those using HTTP/1.0. The second line of the request contains the address of the server which is \"www.codecademy.com\" . There may be additional lines as well depending on what data your browser chooses to send. If the server is able to locate the path requested, the server might respond with the header: HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: text/html This header is followed by the content requested, which in this case is the information needed to render www.codecademy.com . The first line of the header, HTTP/1.1 200 OK , is confirmation that the server understands the protocol that the client wants to communicate with ( HTTP/1.1 ), and an HTTP status code signifying that the resource was found on the server. The third line, Content-Type: text/html , shows the type of content that it will be sending to the client. If the server is not able to locate the path requested by the client, it will respond with the header: HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND In this case, the server identifies that it understands the HTTP protocol, but the 404 NOT FOUND status code signifies that the specific piece of content requested was not found. This might happen if the content was moved or if you typed in the URL path incorrectly or if the page was removed. You can read more about the 404 status code, commonly called a 404 error, here . An Analogy: \u2691 It can be tricky to understand how HTTP functions because it\u2019s difficult to examine what your browser is actually doing. (And perhaps also because we explained it using acronyms that may be new to you.) Let\u2019s review what we learned by using an analogy that could be more familiar to you. Imagine the internet is a town. You are a client and your address determines where you can be reached. Businesses in town, such as Codecademy.com, serve requests that are sent to them. The other houses are filled with other clients like you that are making requests and expecting responses from these businesses in town. This town also has a crazy fast mail service, an army of mail delivery staff that can travel on trains that move at the speed of light. Suppose you want to read the morning newspaper. In order to retrieve it, you write down what you need in a language called HTTP and ask your local mail delivery staff agent to retrieve it from a specific business. The mail delivery person agrees and builds a railroad track (connection) between your house and the business nearly instantly, and rides the train car labeled \u201cTCP\u201d to the address of the business you provided. Upon arriving at the business, she asks the first of several free employees ready to fulfill the request. The employee searches for the page of the newspaper that you requested but cannot find it and communicates that back to the mail delivery person. The mail delivery person returns on the light speed train, ripping up the tracks on the way back, and tells you that there was a problem \u201c404 Not Found.\u201d After you check the spelling of what you had written, you realize that you misspelled the newspaper title. You correct it and provide the corrected title to the mail delivery person. This time the mail delivery person is able to retrieve it from the business. You can now read your newspaper in peace until you decide you want to read the next page, at which point, you would make another request and give it to the mail delivery person. What is HTTPS? \u2691 Since your HTTP request can be read by anyone at certain network junctures, it might not be a good idea to deliver information such as your credit card or password using this protocol. Fortunately, many servers support HTTPS, short for HTTP Secure, which allows you to encrypt data that you send and receive. You can read more about HTTPS on Wikipedia . HTTPS is important to use when passing sensitive or personal information to and from websites. However, it is up to the businesses maintaining the servers to set it up. In order to support HTTPS, the business must apply for a certificate from a Certificate Authority .

IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share. Terraform is HashiCorp\u2019s infrastructure as code tool. It lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files, and manages your infrastructure\u2019s lifecycle. Using Terraform has several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure: Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms. The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly. Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments. You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure. Manage any Infrastructure \u2691 Terraform plugins called providers let Terraform interact with cloud platforms and other services via their application programming interfaces (APIs). HashiCorp and the Terraform community have written over 1,000 providers to manage resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Kubernetes, Helm, GitHub, Splunk, and DataDog, just to name a few. Find providers for many of the platforms and services you already use in the Terraform Registry . If you don't find the provider you're looking for, you can write your own. Standardize Deployment Workflow \u2691 Providers define individual units of infrastructure, for example compute instances or private networks, as resources. You can compose resources from different providers into reusable Terraform configurations called modules, and manage them with a consistent language and workflow. Terraform\u2019s configuration language is declarative, meaning that it describes the desired end-state for your infrastructure, in contrast to procedural programming languages that require step-by-step instructions to perform tasks. Terraform providers automatically calculate dependencies between resources to create or destroy them in the correct order. To deploy infrastructure with Terraform: Scope - Identify the infrastructure for your project. Author - Write the configuration for your infrastructure. Initialize - Install the plugins Terraform needs to manage the infrastructure. Plan - Preview the changes Terraform will make to match your configuration. Apply - Make the planned changes. Track your infrastructure \u2691 Terraform keeps track of your real infrastructure in a state file, which acts as a source of truth for your environment. Terraform uses the state file to determine the changes to make to your infrastructure so that it will match your configuration. Collaborate \u2691 Terraform allows you to collaborate on your infrastructure with its remote state backends. When you use Terraform Cloud (free for up to five users), you can securely share your state with your teammates, provide a stable environment for Terraform to run in, and prevent race conditions when multiple people make configuration changes at once. You can also connect Terraform Cloud to version control systems (VCSs) like GitHub, GitLab, and others, allowing it to automatically propose infrastructure changes when you commit configuration changes to VCS. This lets you manage changes to your infrastructure through version control, as you would with application code.

Find the app\u2019s full package name by running Get-AppxPackage | Select Name, PackageFullName and doing a \u201cFind\u201d inside any text editor. Run Remove-AppxPackage -AllUsers [the full package name here] without the square brackets. Hope it works. If it errors out with 0x80073CFA (especially with 0x80070002 in another error code) then you\u2019ll probably have to do a full manual uninstall. Be prepared to spend a couple of hours on this. Manual Uninstall (Windows 10 1803) \u2691 This information is outdated for newer versions of Windows 10. Scroll down for the updated instructions. Huge thanks to the people who made the following forum/blog posts: Microsoft Community ( Archived, page navigation is broken ) Super User (Stack Exchange) ( Archived ) DxSdata ( Archived ) For reference, I was using Windows 10 1803 with the November 2018 cumulative update applied. This is untested on any other version. Manually delete everything that is linked to that app. This includes the following (but is not an exhaustive list) All folders that exactly match the app\u2019s full package name (the package name is obtained by running Get-AppxPackage | Select Name, PackageFullName in PowerShell and looking for the full name). You can find them by running dir /AD /s [your full package name here] All registry entries that exactly match the app\u2019s full package name. You may be able to delete the parent folders as well, use your own judgment to figure out what\u2019s safe or not. Again, make a full system backup before doing this, and verify the backup works first The XML file that matches the app\u2019s package name in C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\ The folder that matches the app\u2019s package name in C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\Packages\\ Any entries referencing the app in C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppxProvisioning.xml Download and install any SQLite database editor.

You can use multiple tools for this, including Process Hacker and the PSTools Suite Open the database C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\StateRepository-Deployment.srd and look for a row in the table AppxManifest that has your app mentioned in the Xml column, and delete that row. Write the changes to disk (I recommend backing up the existing database first to avoid issues). Open the database C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\StateRepository-Machine.srd and delete the row in the table Package that has your app\u2019s full package name in the column PackageFullName . This is a multi-step process, and all the instructions below are for DB Browser for SQLite. On the \u201cDatabase Structure\u201d tab, scroll down until you see the \u201cTriggers\u201d section. Right-click on the TRG_AFTERDELETE_Package_Key trigger and click \u201cCopy Create statement\u201d. You\u2019ll need this for later, so paste it in a text document and keep it handy. Delete the TRG_AFTERDELETE_Package_Key trigger. This is to avoid SQLite complaining about \u201cno such function: sroptions (your SQL statement here)\u201d. Move to the \u201cBrowse Data\u201d tab, find the correct entry in the Package table, and press \u201cDelete Record\u201d.

Manual Uninstall (Windows 10 20H2) \u2691 Updated on 2020-11-28 Thanks to Robin G and Jean B for feedback on the procedure for newer versions of Windows 10. Manually delete everything that is linked to that app. This includes the following (but is not an exhaustive list) All folders that exactly match the app\u2019s full package name (the package name is obtained by running Get-AppxPackage | Select Name, PackageFullName in PowerShell and looking for the full name). You can find them by running dir /AD /s [your full package name here] Some apps have additional packages installed alongside them, for example the Zoom Rooms app has [snip]_neutral_~_r9fg4ykbbcwvc in addition to the main package [snip]_x86__r9fg4ykbbcwvc . Remember to delete these as well! All registry entries that exactly match the app\u2019s full package name. You may be able to delete the parent folders as well, use your own judgment to figure out what\u2019s safe or not. Again, make a full system backup before doing this, and verify the backup works first Keys in the StateRepository cache ( Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\AppModel\\StateRepository\\Cache\\Package\\Data\\ ) are set to read-only for administrators so you might need to launch regedit as SYSTEM. The XML file that matches the app\u2019s package name in C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\ The folder that matches the app\u2019s package name in C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\Packages\\ If the app is a preinstalled or system-wide app then also remove any entries referencing the app in C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppxProvisioning.xml . This can break things if you create a new user profile, so re-add the app once you\u2019ve successfully reinstalled it. Download and install any SQLite database editor. I used DB Browser for SQLite Launch your editor as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM . You can use multiple tools for this, including Process Hacker and the PSTools Suite Open the database C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\StateRepository-Machine.srd and look for any rows that mention your package name. The tables I needed to delete rows from are listed below alongside any additional steps required to delete them (your app may have different entries, this is just what Zoom Rooms needed): Activation In the Database Structure tab, scroll down to the Triggers section Find the trigger called TRG_BEFOREDELETE_Activation_SRJournal Right-click its row and press \u201cCopy Create statement\u201d. Paste it somewhere safe - you\u2019ll need it later. Delete the trigger by right-clicking it and pressing \u201cDelete Trigger\u201d Delete the row in the Activation table Re-add the trigger by pasting the create statement in the \u201cExecute SQL\u201d tab and pressing the \u201cExecute all\u201d button Application Follow the same steps as the Activation table, but this time for the TRG_BEFOREDELETE_Application_SRJournal trigger ApplicationIdentity BundlePackage (find the \u201cBundle\u201d integer here - delete the associated one in \u201cBundle\u201d) MrtApplication MrtPackage Package Save the package ID first - we\u2019ll need it for the next step. Follow the same steps as the Activation table, but this time for the TRG_BEFOREDELETE_Package_SRJournal trigger PackageFamily Follow the same steps as the Activation table, but this time for the TRG_BEFOREDELETE_PackageFamily_SRJournal trigger PackageIdentity PackageLocation Write the changes to disk (I recommend backing up the existing database first to avoid issues). Open the database C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\StateRepository-Deployment.srd and look for a row in the table AppxManifest that has the package ID you previously got from StateRepository-Machine.srd in the Package column. Right-click the rows and delete them. Also do this for the File and PackageSourceUri tables. You can shift-click on multiple records to bulk select. Run wsreset.exe Re-open the Store. The app should now be marked as \u201cOwned\u201d but not \u201cInstalled\u201d and should be reinstallable. If you run into an error, try pressing the \u201cRetry\u201d button and it should eventually redownload. If you don\u2019t plan on reinstalling the app then I still recommend redownloading and uninstalling it to clean up anything not mentioned in this guide. Wrap Up and Finishing Words \u2691 UWP is a fantastic idea. Sandbox absolutely everything and keep each app in its own folder, all with user-friendly controls through the Store and Settings apps. It succeeds in that, and I applaud the Windows team for finally catching up to macOS and some Unixes. However, it can get extremely ugly as soon as something breaks. The only other \u201capproved\u201d or \u201csanctioned\u201d ways to interact with the system are through a group of PowerShell cmdlets, and it\u2019s really hard to peek behind the scenes and get an idea of what it\u2019s actually doing. I only figured out there was a SQLite database controlling all this through a lucky Google search, which really isn\u2019t what I\u2019d want if I was making documentation for Windows. If anyone on the Windows team is reading this, please, please have an option in Settings to force uninstall an app. Spending hours poking through the dark side of Windows to uninstall a single app is incredibly bad UX, and I don\u2019t even know what caused this in the first place. Was it a botched update? Was it a stray gamma ray or something flipping a critical bit? There\u2019s near zero visibility in what UWP does internally. I hope these steps helped you. Feel free to drop me an email if you\u2019ve got any comments, I really appreciate any feedback.

Consider consolidation: Debt consolidation, with a personal loan or a credit card, can lower your interest rate so you\u2019re putting more money toward your balance. Don\u2019t be afraid of debt relief: If you\u2019re not making any progress on your debts, you might want to get some help in the form of debt relief. \u200b Links: Sources:","title":"Pay Off Your Debt: Tools and Tips"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/How%20to%20Ship%20Side%20Projects/","text":"How to Ship Side Projects \u2691 In this post, I\u2019m going to teach you how to ship your side projects. How to turn them into a potential business. Keyword: potential. There are no promises here. I can\u2019t turn water into wine, people. \ud83d\ude09 Now, back to shipping side projects \u2026 It\u2019s easy once you realize how difficult it is. Yeah, that sounds bass-ackwards. \ud83e\udd14 I\u2019m serious, though. It is easy once you see that the difficult thing is looking you in the mirror. Yes, you\u2019re getting in your own way , and you don\u2019t even know it. I\u2019ve been shipping side projects for over 20 years. Some did well, most failed. It\u2019s how it goes. You have to roll with the punches here. What is a side project? A side project could be something as simple as: A weekly newsletter (like this one) A weekly blog post A mobile app you wrote A web app you wrote A tool you created An open-source project you created A script you wrote A framework you developed A physical book you wrote An ebook you wrote A video A tutorial \u2026 You get it. A side project could be anything that you want. For the sake of this post, I\u2019m going to stick with a software product, though. It could be a mobile app or web app, or even a desktop tool. Nuff fluff: Let\u2019s get to it. The sooner you realize that your chances of success are low, the faster you can ship it. You\u2019re thinking: \u201c What? Huh? \u201d Once you embrace this thought \u2026 you have nothing to lose. If you don\u2019t ship your side-project, you\u2019re in no better spot than you are now . The only difference is that you have a bunch of dead code in a folder on your drive somewhere (your project). If it sits on your drive, it\u2019s worth nothing. Yeah, blah blah blah, I know \u2026 you learned something from it, so it\u2019s not entirely useless. I get it \u2026 That\u2019s not why you\u2019re still reading this post, though. You want to learn how to ship it. Right? Right. Embrace the truth that most likely, this project will fail, but you don\u2019t know for certain until you try. I want you to know that I\u2019m not trying to be a downer here. I\u2019m trying to help you realize that this is the reality of shipping side projects. So\u2026 ship it already. You most likely fret over this like crazy. I know I have more times than I\u2019d like to admit. Hell, I still do it. You get stuck in an analysis paralysis loop of the following questions: \u201cHow can I make money off of this?\u201d \u201cWill the user pay for it?\u201d \u201cShould this be a one-time payment or monthly subscription?\u201d \u201cCan I monetize this with ads?\u201d \u201cCan I find enough 43-year-old moms who drive Ford minivans built between the years of 2008-2012 that will buy my custom rear-facing baby dashcam mount?\u201d First of all. Forget ads. That ship has sailed. Storytime \u2013 back in 2008, I had 4.5 million app installs of one of my side project apps, and I was making $60-$100 a day. Things aren\u2019t like that anymore. Yes, that\u2019s good money for a side project, but that didn\u2019t last long. That got shut down soon after the ad rates dropped. Ok, so ads are out \u2026 unless you really do like living off of Ramen from the dollar store. So \u2026 what about the other options? If you don\u2019t have a solid plan out of the gate, ignore pricing right now and ship it. This concept cemented one day after I heard Josh Pigford talk about this on one of his podcasts. The TLDR is this \u2013 if you have a side project \u2013 ship it and get it out there. If it\u2019s popular, then figure out how to monetize it. There will often be a clear path on how to monetize. If not, then run it for a while to see if you can identify a monetization method or shut it down. In other words, if you\u2019re having a hard time deciding how to monetize your side project \u2013 don\u2019t. Ship it and see if the market likes it first. If there is a positive response, then think about it and adjust, but don\u2019t let it distract you from shipping. You had to know this one was coming. This is age-old advice that I still adhere to. As the saying goes, \u201c If you\u2019re not embarrassed by what you shipped, you shipped too late. \u201c Why would you do this? To see if there is any interest in your project. Consider these scenarios: A) You ship early and learn that the market did not respond to your project. No one uses it. Ok, no harm \u2013 no foul. You cut your losses and move on. B) You ship early and find out people like it. You accept their feedback and improve the product. Awesome. C) You don\u2019t ship until it\u2019s perfect. You ship it and realize that your assumptions about the market were wrong. No one uses it, or no one understands it because of many incorrect assumptions made. You realize you wasted a tremendous amount of time. Most everyone defaults to scenario C. They wait until it\u2019s perfect to ship something. Stop it. Ship it now. Your terms and conditions weren\u2019t done? Ship it. Your privacy policy isn\u2019t done yet? Ship it. Your monthly billing isn\u2019t done yet? Ship it. Wait, what? Billing isn\u2019t done \u2026 and ship it? Yes. Ship it. There are many companies that have shipped without functioning billing software. They wanted to get it into the public quick. These companies had another 4 weeks to wrap up the billing stuff while the users gave other valuable feedback. Contact page isn\u2019t done? No problem. Use a form like TypeForm. Ship it. You get the point. Ship it when you\u2019re still somewhat embarrassed by it, and then refine it. I cant\u2019 tell you how many times I\u2019ve done this. This is when your project is YOU. You and your project are one. It\u2019s like a child to you. Bad mistake. You\u2019re setting yourself up for some upset. Ask me how I know. When you attach your emotions to your project, you will make emotional decisions. Emotional decisions are usually not great ones. Furthermore, they\u2019re often slow. This could be anything from pricing decisions to feature decisions to support responses. Anything for that matter. When (not if) users criticize your project, it will sting and often feel like a direct attack . That\u2019s not their intention, but if an emotion is at play, it can feel like an attack. This makes it hard for you to detach and do the work necessary to improve your project once it\u2019s shipped. This is tip #1\u2019s cousin. You already know that your project has a high chance of failure. You\u2019re not upset about it because you\u2019re putting it out there to see if it gets any traction. Another way to look at this is that what you\u2019re doing now is a learning experience. I recently did this with a project called \u201cGifstagram.\u201d It was the easiest way to convert any gif into a loop-able MP4 file that would be post-able on Instagram. I didn\u2019t have any clue if anyone would pay a cent for it, but I knew that I used it and that it could be of use to others. I also wanted to know how to use Amazon AWS Lambda functions, and this was a perfect opportunity to learn how to use them. So that\u2019s what I did \u2026 I created the entire web app on AWS with AWS Lambda, SES, API Gateway, Aurora, and S3. I treated it as a learning experience to say I was able to ship a project that used all these technologies. Let me tell you something \u2026 WOW, I learned a ton on that small project. I recently shut that project down. It was not getting used that much, and there was no clear path to monetization. The learning opportunity was worth its weight in gold, though. Treat your side projects the same way and you always stand to gain something from it. Twizzler? Runts? Skittles? I used to eat the crap out of those. My dentist loved me because I paid him so much money. Ok, I digress\u2026 Your product is \u201cCandy\u201d if \u2026 it\u2019s something a user would like to have and makes their life more enjoyable, but it\u2019s not necessary. Your product is a \u201cVitamin\u201d if \u2026 it\u2019s something that the user should use but can do without if need be. Your product is a \u201cPain Killer\u201d if \u2026 it\u2019s something that the user wants and needs right now to solve a very immediate problem. Which category do you think you want your product to be in? Pain killer. Why? Think of it this way: You\u2019ve got a toothache. What do you want? Candy? A vitamin? or a Pain Killer? You want the pain killer. You want the problem to go away. If your product makes a problem go away \u2013 it\u2019s a pain killer. If your product makes their problem less as bad, it\u2019s a vitamin. If your product makes their life more joyful in some way, it\u2019s candy. Why are these all-important? It\u2019s important because it will help you plan on how to sustain the project over the long term. Will it be something you can monetize, or is this a goodwill project? This helps frame the project and its potential trajectory in the market. Think of it this way \u2013 pain killers do better than vitamins, and vitamins do better than candy. They can all work, but where do you want to spend your time? Personally, I prefer to work on painkillers. In the previous tips, you learned that you can use shipping a side project as a learning experience. This is great, but when do you pull the plug on your shipped project ? Or should you? To know that, you need an exit plan. This could be monetizing your project by a certain date . It could be getting some maintainers to help you with your open source project by a certain date . This could be shutting it down if certain metrics are not met by a certain date . It could be selling your side project if you lose interest in it by a certain date . Notice everything is date-oriented . Nothing should be perpetual. If it is, it will take up mental cycles in the background of your head . This will eat away at your personal processing power for other projects that you have. If you plan on selling it, you can sell on an app marketplace or website marketplace. No, you\u2019re not going to get 15x of your time you put into it. You might get a couple thousand, or if you have a lot of users but no monetization, you might get more. Don\u2019t expect to get rich, though. See it as a nice bonus and a responsibility you no longer have to tend to. It\u2019s important to know that you don\u2019t have to love your side project forever . You will outgrow it. If you get tired of your side project, have a plan for what to do with it. Shut it down. Sell it. Deprecate it if it\u2019s an open-source library. Do something, but don\u2019t let it sit around. It will take up precious mental cycles. Ship it early. Get feedback quickly. Don\u2019t wait for it to be perfect. It never will be. PS: By the way, using this exact method I recently re-launched Android Jobs (a Job board for Android professionals). It\u2019s not perfect. In fact, there\u2019s a bunch of stuff that\u2019s simply NOT done yet on it. You know what though, many companies are using it already. Companies like Instacart, Capital One, Bumble, Snapchat, Pandora, Twilio, Vizio \u2026 the list can go on and on. Long story short \u2013 your product doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to provide value. Just ship it.

When you outsource tasks, you need to make sure that the person executing the job is fully equipped with all the tools, instructions, and knowledge to perform the said task. How do you ensure that? Simple, you create an SOP (referenced as SOP going forward). An SOP is a standard operating procedure. An SOP is a document that contains all of the necessary information for someone to accomplish a task. It will contain things like, but not limited to: Usernames and passwords or where to find them (I recommend using a password manager like 1Password or LastPass) How to perform the task in a step by step fashion with screenshots if possible Flow charts and decision trees if the process can take many branches based upon previous outcomes. What to do when something goes wrong How to measure success A straightforward example of an SOP would be how to categorize transactions in your accounting system. You would create this document so that it could easily be shared with others, such as an online doc like Google Docs or something similar. Example SOP: Filename: bank-transaction-categorization-sop Title: Bank Transaction Categorization SOP Steps Log into accounting software ( Username and password will be shared with you over email via LastPass or 1Password.

Once logged in, go to Accounting -> Ledger -> Checking Register Selected the \u201cUncategorized Tab\u201d For each transaction, please categorize it accordingly to its appropriate category. Rules of thumb: All restaurants, coffee, and similar: Categorize as Meals and Entertainment. All Software Purchases: Categorize as Technology \u2013 Software For Amazon.com purchases, please send me the $ amount of the transaction, and I\u2019ll send you a screenshot of what it was. You can split this transaction into multiple categories. This situation would happen if I bought a book on consulting sales and a new mouse pad. They would have two different categorizations; therefore, the transaction needs to exist into two distinct categories. \u2026 etc. (more rules of thumb if you have them) If you find a transaction that you\u2019re unsure of how to categorize, please put it into a spreadsheet and share the spreadsheet with me after you\u2019ve completed all the categorization. Then email me once you\u2019re ready for me to take a look. I\u2019ll take a look at the spreadsheet and then update the expense it belongs in. Once I get this done, please come back to the accounting software so that you can continue to enter the proper categorizations for the items in question.

Please update this document to reflect changes if any of the processes change while working on this task. Thank you! Why you want an SOP for everything you outsource The reason is pretty simple \u2013 it allows you to get someone up and running on a new process quickly. If an employee or contractor leaves, you want to get someone started on that position quickly. In other words, you want to hire and promptly train someone to do the job that the other person was doing for you. When you have an SOP, you can do that fairly quickly. I know, yes, sometimes the requirements of a job change over time, and the original SOP might not be applicable anymore. This is why keeping your SOP updated is so important. When the requirements of the task change, have the person performing the task up the SOP for you. An SOP makes your life easier so you can run your business more efficiently. When this person does move onto new things in their life, and they\u2019re no longer helping you run your business, you\u2019ll be able to hire someone new and hand them an SOP for each task you want them to perform. Each SOP should read like a tutorial. They should complete the task without any intervention from you (though they will when starting). It should cover any edge cases that exist. If they don\u2019t, they should always know to reach out to you if they have a problem. Upon resolving a new problem, that same problem and resolution need to go back into the SOP for future reference. As you build a library of SOP\u2019s, you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re just documenting and systematizing your business. This will allow you to scale even more than you usually would. Instead of spending a day or two or a week training someone, you cut that back to a few minutes or even a few hours at most. You also appear much more professional to the people you bring on to help you out. It makes their life easier because they have a system that they can follow. When you eliminate decisions, you eliminate the errors. This is a fine line, though; you don\u2019t want to eliminate all the decision-making because sometimes others have excellent ideas that you should adopt. However, these tasks, they\u2019re relatively menial. They don\u2019t require much creativity, which is why they\u2019re great candidates for outsourcing to free up your time. What kind of things should you or can you outsource? Anything that is not your core focus should is open for outsourcing. If you\u2019re a software developer, you shouldn\u2019t be doing accounting and categorizing transactions, editing photos, or anything like that. If you want to do those things, you can, no harm/no foul, but it\u2019s probably not the best use of your time. Somethings that I have outsourced include: Bookkeeping Podcast Editing Video Editing Brand Style Development Software Development for my SaaS products Graphic Design Video Editing Newsletter Management Job Board Management I do advise that you do all of these things first to see what is entailed in them. I hope that helps.

They stored all of their documents in them in a structured way so that they could find them again. Now those same people store all of their files in arbitrarily named folders on their company\u2019s shared drive and wonder why they can\u2019t find anything. Nobody can find anything any more \u2691 Thousands of emails. Hundreds of files. File structures created on a whim and six layers deep. Duplicated content, lost content. We thought search would save us from this nightmare, but we were wrong. It\u2019s time to get organised \u2691 There are a couple of core concepts, and they\u2019re so simple you\u2019ll wonder why you haven\u2019t thought of them before. It\u2019s worth mentioning at this point that all of this is free, and it\u2019s possible to implement it without any additional tools. Step 1: Divide everything in to ten things \u2691 Take everything you need to organise and sort it in to, at most, ten large buckets. Make sure the buckets are unambiguously different. Put a label on each bucket. This forces you to group things quite broadly, but that\u2019s the point. We call these buckets your areas. An area might be Finance . Step 2: In each area, divide in ten again \u2691 Go through each bucket and repeat the process. This creates your categories . A category within the Finance area might be Tax Returns . Now we have ten areas which contain ten categories each. That\u2019s a hundred categories at the very most . It\u2019s very unlikely you will end up with a hundred categories. Categories are the key \u2691 What\u2019s a category? It\u2019s just a collection of stuff. Book drafts. Travel itineraries. Lease agreements. Test reports. Contracts. Any type of work you do can become a category. The point is that you\u2019ve defined these categories, each of which is contained within a broader area. You do this when you set up your system, which we\u2019ll get to shortly. We give each category a number \u2691 Remember they\u2019re grouped in tens, so our first ten categories will be numbers 10-19 and they will all be related to each other. Let\u2019s say 10-19 is our Finance area. Category 11 might be Tax returns , 12 Payroll , and so on. From this we know that 42 will not be a finance-related category. This is the power of the system: you know where you absolutely should not bother looking to find your data. Now we bring in the numbers \u2691 A Johnny.Decimal number looks like this: 42.1812.0363.17 They\u2019re short, memorable, and can be spoken out loud. They\u2019re always two digits, a decimal point, and two more digits. Say it like \u201cforty-two eighteen\u201d or \u201ctwelve dot oh-three\u201d. Before the decimal: category \u2691 The decimal point is there to break the number up, but more importantly to remind you that the number before the decimal is the important part. It\u2019s the category. The category tells you which area it\u2019s in, because all areas start with the same number. If your category starts with the digit 1 , that\u2019s something to do with Finance . At a glance, you know what the number contains. You\u2019ll be astonished at how many of your category numbers you remember. After the decimal: ID \u2691 The number after the decimal is just a counter. We call it the ID: it starts at .01 and increases with each thing you create. In these examples, 42.18 is the 18th thing you\u2019ve saved in your 42 category. The 3rd thing you\u2019ve saved in your 12 Payroll category might be 12.03 Payroll schedule 2018 . The ID doesn\u2019t have any relevance to the item itself \u2013 remember, it\u2019s just a counter. I get the idea, but why bother? \u2691 Many, many reasons. Organise your files \u2691 The most obvious use of Johnny.Decimal is in organising your folder structure. This is a folder structure for a small company. (The reasoning behind the folder naming structure will be explained later.) Notice how we have four areas, each with a couple of categories. None of the areas or categories overlap. There\u2019s only one place anything can ever be. Even if you weren\u2019t familiar with this folder structure, you\u2019d be able to find your way to the sales proposals directory. Nothing is more than two clicks away \u2691 An important restriction of the system is that you\u2019re not allowed to create any folders inside a Johnny.Decimal folder. This means that you\u2019ll never get lost in layers upon layers of folders. It also makes you create quite specific folders for each thing, ensuring that you can always find what you want. Tell people where things are \u2691 \u201cHey Kristy, where can I find the payroll schedule?\u201d \u201cTwelve dot oh-three.\u201d Thanks, Kristy. Fix your email \u2691 Put the Johnny.Decimal number in your email subject and you\u2019ve instantly categorised everything. Your colleagues will think you have mystical powers because you\u2019ll actually be able to find email again . Display it on printed copies \u2691 Rather than including the complete file path on printed documentation, just add the Johnny.Decimal number. Open files and folders instantly \u2691 Because your folders contain the Johnny.Decimal number, you can open them without reaching for the mouse. Mac users \u2691 Press \u2318+space to bring up Spotlight . Type a Johnny.Decimal number. Press Return. (If you like this sort of thing, check out Alfred .) Windows users \u2691 Hit the Windows key. Type a Johnny.Decimal number in the Search box. Press Return. Command-line users \u2691 Tab completion becomes a joy when your folders start with structured, predictable numbers. Build a small Bash script to pop you in to any folder instantly: ~ $ cjd 12.03 12.03 Payroll for 2018 $ _ Tag things in real life \u2691 Managing physical objects? Write the Johnny.Decimal number on a sticky note. Sold? Let\u2019s go \u2691 By now you either see the power of this and want more , or you\u2019re confused and sad .

Kubernetes is popular for its appealing architecture, a large and active community and the continuous need for extensibility that enables countless development teams to deliver and maintain software at scale by automating container orchestration. Kubernetes maps out how applications should work and interact with other applications. Due to its elasticity, it can scale services up and down as required, perform rolling updates, switch traffic between different versions of your applications to test features or rollback problematic deployments.

Containers are a modern way to virtualise infrastructure, more lightweight approach than traditional virtual machines: all containers in single host OS share the kernel and other resources, require less memory space, ensure greater resource utilisation and shorter startup times by several orders of magnitude.

Heck, to this day I\u2019m still learning how to program. In software, the day you stop learning is the day you become obsolete. It was late 1998 and I was in the same boat as the author. The feeling was one of inferiority when compared to the accolades of accomplishments that the tech folks who were my age were already sporting. Programming homework assignments took me 6-12 hours, it took them 20 minutes. I think I even failed my first programming course if I remember correctly. Well, maybe not failed, but I got a \u201cW\u201d for withdrawing so it did now show up on my academic report as a fail. Here\u2019s something most people in the industry don\u2019t know about me \u2026 I did not touch a computer until I was nearly 21. The internet was already in full swing. To put some perspective on it \u2013 A year later Mark Cuban sold Broadcast.com for $5.7 Billion. It was the middle of the tech bubble. At that point, I had not even learned how to type yet. I was a keyboard pecking chicken-hawk who was way out of his league. I saw others (though did not know them personally) that seemed \u201cgifted\u201d in the area of computers and I wanted to try like them. I tried to emulate them. I failed, hard. Unfortunately (and fortunately for them) they started much earlier than I. I could not keep up, I just didn\u2019t have the same background that they did. You see, I was raised in a small town in northern California (Shingletown, CA to be exact). The population was only around 1000 people. In Shingletown our days consisted of playing outdoors, building forts, climbing waterfalls, camping etc. I eventually got into racing motocross and that got me out of the hills and into different cities to experience more of the state of California. I got to see people, I got to taste what life was like outside of the hills. I liked it. The funny thing is that I actually encountered computers because of Motorcycles. I moved to Phoenix in 97\u2019 to go to MMI (Motorcycle Mechanics Institute) after hanging up my boots in pursuit of a motocross career (I just didn\u2019t have it). Then I found the internet \u2026 I happenstance stumbled upon the internet one day while waiting for a girlfriend to get ready to go out. She said Here, sit down, search for something on the internet while I get ready. She showed me how to use Alta Vista (the main search engine prior to Google and Yahoo) and a few minutes later I got hooked. The first search I ever did on the internet? A search for AFI , the band, in 1998 (I was REALLY into music and motorcycles back then). I saw a wall of information that I had never seen before. I was amazed. I performed one search, then another, then another. I was hooked. I could not believe all this info was available. Two weeks later I bought my first computer. To be 100% honest, I didn\u2019t have much money back then \u2013 in fact I was broke. I didn\u2019t have the money at all. I was providing for myself at that age with no parental support. Buying a computer was a humongous expenditure. Therefore, it put me in the poor house for a while. So, I didn\u2019t buy real food, I bought Ramen (not joking here, not at all). I ate it for 3 weeks straight and got sick as a dog (lesson learned \u2013 ramen profitable is just a term, it\u2019s not really sustainable \u2013 lol), but I did have a computer. It was one of the best investments I ever did now that I look back on it. I finally had a computer and I was stoked. I had a problem though \u2026 a very big problem \u2026 no one I knew had a computer. I was alone in this venture. Remember, I was going to a Motorcycle Mechanic school, not a computer school. I had to figure it out all by myself. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I re-formated my computer. I reformatted because I got my computer into a state in which I had no idea how to recover from. Safe mode scared the crap out of me. A year or so after getting a computer I installed an early version of Java over 8 times which resulted in numerous evenings spent reformatting my computer . The only thing I knew how to do was put in the re-format disc that came with my computer and reset it. Even learning to do that took many hours if not a day or two, it\u2019s hard to remember. That took me back to step one. After that, I\u2019d try again. Later I\u2019d learn that what I was doing was called \u201cDebugging\u201d. It wasn\u2019t the code\u2019s problem \u2013 it was me. I was debugging myself and how I understood computers. That took hours, days, months of time. Each time I reformatted and tried something new, I got farther, but by god was I frustrated. There were many times I\u2019d get pissed as hell and walk away for a day and say \u201cForget it, I\u2019m not smart enough for this\u201d. Fortunately, I\u2019ve always been one to never give up. I came back. I always came back. I eventually stopped doing that Java stuff in school (I hated it \u2026 funny now that I\u2019m an accomplished Android *cough*Java*cough* author and consultant). I originally started doing web dev because I thought the internet was amazing. So much info, so much at my fingertips that I never had access to. I had no idea how to do build a web page though. So I went and bought the first version of this book in 1998 at Barnes in Nobel at the Metrocenter Mall location in Phoenix. This was my first computer/tech book that I had ever bought. I spent hours in the computer section at various stores from that point forward. Learning more and more on my days and nights off. I may have learned a lot, but I ran into a lot of problems. Crashes. Borking my machine. MANY Reformatting sessions. Etc. I\u2019d screw up, and then have to reformat my computer. I\u2019d then start over again and with each new accomplishment came a hit of dopamine. The excitement was unreal. I was figuring it out! Each new script I wrote ( alert(\u201cIn here\u201d); Seriously, who remembers that! I still bump int that all over the web. Ha!) Anyway, I felt like I was part of the machine. I knew I was getting a step further. I felt like I was walking on the edge of the universe at times. Barely being able to cling onto the safety net of a working computer only to end in another reformat was frustrating as hell. Learning to program and not having a firm understanding of computers was like a demented video game where re-spawning took 2-3 hours (time it took to reformat). It sucked. I hated it at times, but I kept coming back because I loved it and I knew I didn\u2019t want to do what I was doing the rest of my life \u2013 working on motorcycles or being a rep at a call center. I knew that this computer stuff was something special. But still, all these problems made it difficult to learn and progress and I realized one thing early on during this process \u2026 Learning to program sucks. Your machine has to be set up perfectly, your environment has to be set up correctly and you have to be using the right tools. Otherwise \u2026 it won\u2019t work. I spent days trying to figure out a system configuration issue just so I could get back to programming (we still all run into that on occasion). So yeah\u2026 learning to program sucks. It does. The thing is \u2026 I wish I had a solution to that problem, but I don\u2019t have one. However, upon further review and after a few edits to this article I\u2019m beginning to think that the answer hidden in plain sight. It is the advice I always give everyone. The best advice I can give is the same advice I give to my kids when they\u2019re working on a difficult math problem or doing programming exercises with me \u2013 \u201c Don\u2019t give up. Keep going. Don\u2019t EVER give up. It will get easier. \u201d Furthermore, I\u2019d have to say that in order to truly learn how to program and get things done you need to stop reading books and start building something. Keep the books, you may need them. But what you need to do is build something, build anything ! Then add to it and get people to use it, even if its only for your friends. Yes, what you build will break and then you\u2019ll learn more about programming by fixing the problem. You will learn a ton. Then do it again. Make something new and publish it/ship it again. You\u2019ll learn so much in the process its ridiculous. Eventually, your confidence will grow (albeit sometimes a bit too much) and when you get good enough you can apply for a junior developer role. When I finally got a DevOps position (back then it was just called \u201cTech Support\u201d for the servers) at Target Financial Services (Target\u2019s credit card) in 2000 I was beyond grateful. I didn\u2019t care if it was networking or programming or whatever. It was in tech! I was stoked. It was my first tech job I had. I went to work and I loved it. I felt alive. I was not in a mundane job anymore. I still feel this way. I\u2019m very grateful for what I\u2019m able to do. Prior to that, I did tech stuff, but it was for small businesses and friends and such \u2013 I was still learning. I was making websites and helping friends (and a couple small businesses) set up networks. Getting a job at Target Financial was a huge win and a great confidence booster. However \u2026 I did bring down the server on my very first day and cost the company 30K in under 2 hours, oops. That\u2019s a story for another time. I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t get fired. Thanks Jason ! \ud83d\ude42 Just know this \u2026 whatever you\u2019re doing, trust in yourself. Trust in what you can do. Even if you suck at it now. If a nobody (such as myself) can come from small-town America and write a best selling programming book and become relatively well known in the industry all while knowing nothing when I started \u2026 well \u2026 guess what \u2013 you can too. Keep going and don\u2019t give up because the one sure fire way to fail is to give up. Remind yourself daily if you have to: Don\u2019t EVER give up. Keep going. Persevere. Try again. Keep going. It WILL get easier.

Think of your Projects list as a current table of contents of the current outcomes on your plate. Most people have 10-100 current projects, personally and professionally. Current projects have at least one next action, waiting for, or calendar action, in order to be considered current. Projects that have no current next action, waiting for, or calendar action are either no longer projects for you, or should be incubated to Someday/Maybe. Future actions (i.e., actions that are dependent on something else happening first) do not go on the Next Actions lists until you can take action on them. They get stored with project plans. The Projects list and project plans are typically reviewed in your GTD Weekly Review, ensuring each project has at least one current next action, waiting for, or calendar item. It\u2019s fine to have multiple next actions on any given project, as long as they are parallel and not sequential actions (e.g., \u201cBuy stamps\u201d and \u201cMail invitations\u201d would not both be on Next Actions lists for the \u201cPut on Party for David\u201d project given that you need to buy the stamps before you can mail the invitations). Projects are listed by the outcome you will achieve when you can mark it as done (what will be true?). Effective project names motivate you toward the outcome you wish to achieve, and give you clear direction about what you are trying to accomplish. How well are you doing on these? Where do you have any gaps? What is going well for you?

The problems stemming from a lack of staying mindful and in-tune with one's actions have tremendous negative consequences, yet the ease of falling down the path of Information Overload & The Rabbit Hole Trap is seemingly more difficult than ever to avoid. Addiction to information can cause a complete breakdown of one's ability to stay mindful and focused on staying accountable, getting results , and finishing your work . It is very easy to get lost down a rabbit hole and create an unhealthy environment consumed by insignificant, yet vast amounts of unecessary information, overloading your ability to stay mindful and on-task. Stay focused on direct production of results. If something is not helpful to your initial desired outcome STOP . In order to accomplish this you must first build the habit of actually thinking about what you are doing on a persistent basis. A huge issue is with analysis paralysis and decision fatigue coupled with a lack of self confidence and inner creativity. Elaboration of a Typical Mindless Endeavor \u2691 To elaborate, when faced with a problem requiring a creative solution or decision, my first instinct is to immediately outsource to outside help online. This occurs on both complex, abstract problems which require innovative solutions as well as extremely simple and insignificant decisions. (i.e what should I name this folder, or what is the indisputably perfect way to organize my task list, etc). A typical rabbit hole trap situation usually follows a progression similar to as follows: I am faced with a problem - could be small, big, difficult, urgent, irrelevant - it doesn't matter. The brain triggers an amazing new opportunity to learn some new and life changing solution and the best way to find this solution is online via the infinite wisdom of the almighty internet. Start searching and hoarding information on Google, Reddit, etc. initially for a solution See another interesting way to solve the problem and then another interesting, cool piece of information shows up about a new app with a word that triggers another spark that I resonate with. Usually in a way that has nothing to do with initial reason for researching! Have overloaded browser full of tabs, wasted money on useless new products, cloudy brain that has forgotten what the initial purpose actually was and no sense of clarity because the desired outcome has now become completely blurred by overload . Realize that hours upon hours have passed, my brain is fatigued, and I've lost touch with my days purpose. I forget to eat, sleep, exercise and keep in touch with those I love and respect. Mindfulness as Your Guiding Compass \u2691 Use Mindfulness as a gauge for situational awareness. Mindfulness is like your compass, but instead of it being static and bound to a static environment, it is ever evolving to the environment around it: mindfulness acts as your gyroscope 1 Sticking with this gyroscope analogy: A gyroscope, very broadly speaking, acts as a compass to aid with overall navigation and orientation. The gyroscope is capable of rotating and autocorrecting based on the objects position in space and time (i.e. tilting cup holders on a plane that adjust accordingly to external forces such as tilt and turbulence). Brain First, Results Later \u2691 Mindfulness requires more than action, it require deep behavioral and psychological strength and stability to build up over time. In other words, change the way you think in order to think about the ways you act . Staying mindful requires deep habitual and mental changes as well as self discipline. Identify Problems you are currently experiencing or attempting to resolve, and be honest yourself. Determine your Motivation or Triggers behind these specific problems you experience. Build a habit (use a reminder, alarm, or the Pomodoro Technique if necessary) of frequently and persistently checking in on yourself and your thoughts. Ask yourself \"What am I doing and Why?\". This will help you determine the underlying root-causes behind your problems you are experiencing as well as force you to at least decide to waste time as opposed to not even realizing what you are doing. Trust Your First Brain \u2691 Recently, there has been a surge around the realm of Personal Knowledge Management and Building a Second Brain . As much as I personally enjoy these topics, I have found that the exciting pursuit of new information and knowledge can interfere with my ability to simply get things done. It is important to realize that our brains are fundamentally different, and much more sophisticated and talented, than a system such as the internet which simply hoards data in different ways. The brain derives knowledge in a much more involved process, through molding and restructuring networked thoughts resulting in a curation of a creative, personalized knowledge store built from past lessons-learned and one's previously built skillsets and education. Context is King \u2691 When faced with situational problems to solve throughout the day, think about the context in which you placed yourself to find a solution. If the problem you are facing or the lesson you are trying to learn needs external research: it is easy to take the road most traveled and scavange the internet for the perfect, elegant solution. However these attempts to find the perfect solution, more often than not are either: Too simplistic, vague, and shallow to be helpful or Too specific, abstract, and opinionated Too complex given your original problem does not need an overly complex solution. There's a reason for this and it's that my problem is specific to the context in which I am faced with it and nobody online it dealing with the exact same issue in the exact same context as me. The Problem with Vagueness \u2691 Online articles are rarely specific and are purposefully more vague in order to cause one to expand their horizons, avoiding the initial endeavor, and allowing for an easy target to click bait. Aside from the adds the simple links in articles to every ephemeral resource related to nothing helpful become the golden solution to all your problems. Concluding Thoughts \u2691 Counterintuitive and often simple solutions frequently solve the grandest farthest reaching problems. Thinking and forcing deep mental endeavors is more valuable, healthy, and efficient than deciding to find an easy, shallow, thoughtless solution. Irrational thinking due to addiction to technology and information. Dive deeper into the things I am already pursuing myself. Stop consuming redundant information phrased differently. Instead, building on what I already know and using the resources I have mentally retained due to actual helpfulness stems a much quicker and elegant solution. Instead of always reverting to online resources - stay mindful and in-tune with your own personal priorities. Don't try and solve everything at once, but tackle one thing at a time and be disciplined in your fight against mindlessness . Stay mindful and you will find your pursuit of knowledge becomes a deeper, more interesting journey that is specific to your own personal way of thinking and though processes. Collecting and hoarding others information online is not a good use of time and is a direct result of one's lack of confidence, issues with perfectionism, and an unwillingness to finish what you start through procrastination.

It is important to realize that our brains are fundamentally different, and much more sophisticated and talented, than a system such as the internet which simply hoards data in different ways. The brain derives knowledge in a much more involved process, through molding and restructuring networked thoughts curating a creative, personalized knowledge-store built from past lessons-learned and one's acquired skills and wisdom. Context is King \u2691 When faced with situational problems to solve throughout the day, think about the context in which you placed yourself to find a solution. If the problem you are facing or the lesson you are trying to learn needs external research: it is easy to take the road most traveled and scavenge the internet for the perfect, elegant solution. However these attempts to find the perfect solution, more often than not are either: Too simplistic, vague, and shallow to be helpful Too specific, abstract, and opinionated Too complex given your original problem does not need an overly complex solution. There's a reason for this and it's that my problem is specific to the context in which I am faced with it and nobody online it dealing with the exact same issue in the exact same context as me. The Problem with Vagueness \u2691 Online articles are rarely specific and are purposefully more vague in order to cause one to expand their horizons, avoiding the initial endeavor, and allowing for an easy target to click bait. Aside from the adds the simple links in articles to every ephemeral resource related to nothing helpful become the golden solution to all your problems. Concluding Thoughts \u2691 ==Counter-intuitive and often simple solutions frequently solve the grandest farthest reaching problems. Thinking and forcing deep mental endeavors is more valuable, healthy, and efficient than deciding to find an easy, shallow, thoughtless solution. == ==Irrational thinking due to addiction to technology and information. Dive deeper into the things I am already pursuing myself. Stop consuming redundant information phrased differently. Instead, building on what I already know and using the resources I have mentally retained due to actual helpfulness stems a much quicker and elegant solution.== Instead of always reverting to online resources - stay mindful and in-tune with your own personal priorities. Don't try and solve everything at once, but tackle one thing at a time and be disciplined in your fight against mindlessness . Stay mindful and you will find your pursuit of knowledge becomes a deeper, more interesting journey that is specific to your own personal way of thinking and though processes. Collecting and hoarding others information online is not a good use of time and is a direct result of one's lack of confidence, issues with perfectionism, and an unwillingness to finish what you start through procrastination.

This occurs on both complex, abstract problems which require innovative solutions as well as extremely simple and insignificant decisions.

A typical rabbit hole trap situation usually follows a progression similar to as follows: I am faced with a problem - could be small, big, difficult, urgent, irrelevant - it doesn't matter. The brain triggers an amazing new opportunity to learn some new and life changing solution and the best way to find this solution is online via the infinite wisdom of the almighty internet. Start searching and hoarding information on Google, Reddit, etc. initially for a solution See another interesting way to solve the problem and then another interesting, cool piece of information shows up about a new app with a word that triggers another spark that I resonate with. Usually in a way that has nothing to do with initial reason for researching! Have overloaded browser full of tabs, wasted money on useless new products, cloudy brain that has forgotten what the initial purpose actually was and no sense of clarity because the desired outcome has now become completely blurred by overload .

Identify Problems you are currently experiencing or attempting to resolve, and be honest yourself. Determine your Motivation or Triggers behind these specific problems you experience. Build a habit (use a reminder, alarm, or the Pomodoro Technique if necessary) of frequently and persistently checking in on yourself and your thoughts. Ask yourself \"What am I doing and Why?\".

Due to plumber\u2019s incredible flexibility, most major API design decisions are left up to the developer. One important consideration to be made when developing APIs is how to log information about API requests and responses. This information can be used to determine how plumber APIs are performing and how they are being utilized. An example of logging API requests in plumber is included in the package documentation . That example uses a filter to log information about incoming requests before a response has been generated. This is certainly a valid approach, but it means that the log cannot contain details about the response since the response hasn\u2019t been created yet. In this post we will look at an alternative approach to logging plumber APIs that uses preroute and postroute hooks to log information about each API request and its associated response. Logging \u2691 Logging packages for R: logger Example API \u2691 In this example, I use the logger package to generate the actual log entries. Using this package isn\u2019t required, but it does provide some convenient functionality that we will take advantage of. Since we will be registering hooks for our API, we will need both a plumber.R file and an entrypoint.R file. The plumber.R file contains the following: # plumber.R library ( plumber ) #* @apiTitle Logging Example #* @apiDescription Simple example API for implementing logging with Plumber #* Echo back the input #* @param msg The message to echo #* @get /echo function ( msg = \"\" ) { list ( msg = paste0 ( \"The message is: '\" , msg , \"'\" )) } #* Plot a histogram #* @png #* @get /plot function () { rand <- rnorm ( 100 ) hist ( rand ) } Now that we\u2019ve defined two endpoints ( /echo and /plot ), we can use entrypoint.R to setup logging using preroute and postroute hooks. First, we need to configure the logger package: # entrypoint.R library ( plumber ) # logging library ( logger ) # Specify how logs are written log_dir <- \"logs\" if ( ! fs :: dir_exists ( log_dir )) fs :: dir_create ( log_dir ) log_appender ( appender_tee ( tempfile ( \"plumber_\" , log_dir , \".log\" ))) The log_appender() function is used to specify which appender method is used for logging. Here we use appender_tee() so that logs will be written to stdout and to a specific file path. We create a directory called logs/ in the current working directory to store the resulting logs. Every log file is assigned a unique name using tempfile() . This prevents errors that can occur if concurrent processes try to write to the same file. Now, we need to create a helper function that we will use when creating log entries: convert_empty <- function ( string ) { if ( string == \"\" ) { \"-\" } else { string } } This function takes an empty string and converts it into a dash ( \"-\" ). We will use this to ensure that empty log values still get recorded so that it is easy to read the log files. We\u2019re now ready to create our plumber router and register the hooks necessary for logging: pr <- plumb ( \"plumber.R\" ) pr $ registerHooks ( list ( preroute = function () { # Start timer for log info tictoc :: tic () }, postroute = function ( req , res ) { end <- tictoc :: toc ( quiet = TRUE ) # Log details about the request and the response log_info ( '{convert_empty(req$REMOTE_ADDR)} \"{convert_empty(req$HTTP_USER_AGENT)}\" {convert_empty(req$HTTP_HOST)} {convert_empty(req$REQUEST_METHOD)} {convert_empty(req$PATH_INFO)} {convert_empty(res$status)} {round(end$toc - end$tic, digits = getOption(\"digits\", 5))}' ) } ) ) pr Links: MOC - R Source: Plumber Logging \u00b7 R Views (rstudio.com)","title":"Plumber Logging"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Plumber%20Logging/#plumber-logging","text":"The plumber R package is used to expose R functions as API endpoints.

For example, say I wanted to add a new feature / function - the following steps would be used: Using *Git-Flow*, a new branch should be created off the current **development** branch with a name corresponding to the new feature. Once in the new branch, add functions via the **devhist.R** script via . Edit the new .R file and commit changes and push to feature branch. Add tests for new function and document additions via , and document this in the **devhist.R** script. Add example usage of the new feature via , and document this in the **devhist.R** script.

RStudio is updated a couple of times a year. When a new version is available, RStudio will let you know. It\u2019s a good idea to upgrade regularly so you can take advantage of the latest and greatest features. Installation \u2691 Assuming you already have R installed, next you will need to install an IDE to code with, in this case, RStudio. Install the free Version of RStudio Desktop for Windows from the RStudio Website here: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ . Alternatively, use a package manager such as Chocolatey , Scoop , or Winget : # chocolatey cinst rstudio -y # scoop scoop install rstudio # --global if want system-wide # winget winget install RStudio . RStudio . OpenSource Daily and Preview Builds \u2691 You can also install various versions of RStudio such as the daily release using the R Bucket for Scoop : RStudio Preview RStudio Daily scoop bucket add r-bucket https :// github . com / cderv / r-bucket . git scoop install r-devel scoop install rstudio-preview scoop install rstudio-pro-preview scoop install rstudio-daily Additional Installations and Utilities \u2691 As an R developer, we come across many other various technologies during development and it can be useful to automate the process of setting up your Developer Environment : Required and Recommended Additional Software and Libraries \u2691 R Tools (required) Git (required) + Git-Bash + a Git Client + Git LFS (optional) Python (recommended) - will need reticulate package for interacting with Python radian - A python package providing a much more developer friendly interface than the native rterm R-Terminal.

Most of these are self-explanatory but it is worth mentioning a few that can boost your programming efficiency: I highly recommend un-ticking the default \u201cRestore .RData\u201d settings box: Unticking this default prevents loading previously created R objects. This will make starting R quicker and reduce the chance of getting bugs due to previously created objects. For this reason, I recommend you untick this box. Alternatively you can simply run this code: require ( usethis ) usethis :: use_blank_slate ( scope = \"user\" ) See ?usethis::use_blank_slate for more information. Other Preferences \u2691 GIT/SVN project settings allow RStudio to provide a graphical interface to your version control system. R version settings allow RStudio to \u2018point\u2019 to different R versions/interpreters, which may be faster for some projects. Code editing options can make RStudio adapt to your coding style, for example, by preventing the autocompletion of braces, which some experienced programmers may find annoying. Enabling Vim mode makes RStudio act as a (partial) Vim emulator. Diagnostic settings can make RStudio more efficient by adding additional diagnostics or by removing diagnostics if they are slowing down your work. This may be an issue for people using RStudio to analyze large datasets on older low-spec computers. Appearance : if you are struggling to see the source code, changing the default font size may make you a more efficient programmer by reducing the time overheads associated with squinting at the screen. Other options in this area relate more to aesthetics. Settings such as font type and background color are also important because feeling comfortable in your programming environment can boost productivity. Go to Tools > Global Options to modify these. Advanced Configuration \u2691 This section discusses more advanced R related configurations such as: - Environment Paths - Detailed System Information - Dotfiles - Common pitfalls For more advanced R developers you may want to further configure your development environement by customizing you R related dotfiles; specifically, your .Rprofile and .Renviron . Environment and %PATH% Variables \u2691 %appdata%\\RStudio - RStudio Configuration Directory (Preferences) %localappdata%\\RStudio-Desktop - RStudio Desktop Internal State To add your system [[R-Tools]] %PATH% to your .Renviron (easier than manually configuring within windows system settings) run the code: cat ( 'PATH = ${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\\\usr\\\\bin;${PATH}' , file = fs :: path ( Sys.getenv ( \"R_USER\" ), \"/.Renviron\" ), append = TRUE ) alternatively use the command prompt or powershell: setx PATH \"<path to rtools>\" $env:PATH = $env:PATH + \"<path to rtools>\" My Setup \u2691 Here is what my minimal setup includes: Additionally, you can configure keybinding for RStudio addins from RStudio and store them within the .R folder located in your R_USER path. To view this path run Sys.getenv(\"R_USER\") .

On major updates, it is best practice to keep your old version of R on your machine until you are comfortable with the updated R version. When migrating R versions between major patch updates, you will need to re-install you library of R packages. This process can be vastly expedited utilizing installr \u2019s helpful installr::copy.packages.between.libraries() function.

If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance. Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows: let re = new RegExp('ab+c'); Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input. Writing a regular expression pattern \u2691 A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as /abc/ , or a combination of simple and special characters, such as /ab*c/ or /Chapter (\\d+)\\.\\d*/ . The last example includes parentheses, which are used as a memory device. The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later use, as described in Using groups . Note: If you are already familiar with the forms of a regular expression, you may also read the cheatsheet for a quick lookup for a specific pattern/construct. Using simple patterns \u2691 Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match. For example, the pattern /abc/ matches character combinations in strings only when the exact sequence \"abc\" occurs (all characters together and in that order). Such a match would succeed in the strings \"Hi, do you know your abc's?\" and \"The latest airplane designs evolved from slabcraft.\" In both cases the match is with the substring \"abc\" . There is no match in the string \"Grab crab\" because while it contains the substring \"ab c\" , it does not contain the exact substring \"abc\" . Using special characters \u2691 When the search for a match requires something more than a direct match, such as finding one or more b's, or finding white space, you can include special characters in the pattern. For example, to match a single \"a\" followed by zero or more \"b\" s followed by \"c\" , you'd use the pattern /ab*c/ : the * after \"b\" means \"0 or more occurrences of the preceding item.\" In the string \"cbbabbbbcdebc\" , this pattern will match the substring \"abbbbc\" . The following pages provide lists of the different special characters that fit into each category, along with descriptions and examples. Assertions Assertions include boundaries, which indicate the beginnings and endings of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some way that a match is possible (including look-ahead, look-behind, and conditional expressions). Character classes Distinguish different types of characters. For example, distinguishing between letters and digits. Groups and ranges Indicate groups and ranges of expression characters. Quantifiers Indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match. Unicode property escapes Distinguish based on unicode character properties, for example, upper- and lower-case letters, math symbols, and punctuation. If you want to look at all the special characters that can be used in regular expressions in a single table, see the following: Special characters in regular expressions. Characters / constructs Corresponding article \\ , . , \\cX , \\d , \\D , \\f , \\n , \\r , \\s , \\S , \\t , \\v , \\w , \\W , \\0 , \\xhh , \\uhhhh , \\uhhhhh , [\\b] Character classes ^ , $ , x(?=y) , x(?!y) , (?<=y)x , (?<!y)x , \\b , \\B Assertions (x) , (?:x) , (?<Name>x) , x|y , [xyz] , [^xyz] , \\_Number_ Groups and ranges * , + , ? , x{_n_} , x{_n_,} , x{_n_,_m_} Quantifiers \\p{_UnicodeProperty_} , \\P{_UnicodeProperty_} Unicode property escapes Escaping \u2691 If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually searching for a \"*\" , for instance), you must escape it by putting a backslash in front of it. For instance, to search for \"a\" followed by \"*\" followed by \"b\" , you'd use /a\\*b/ \u2014 the backslash \"escapes\" the \"*\" , making it literal instead of special. Similarly, if you're writing a regular expression literal and need to match a slash (\"/\"), you need to escape that (otherwise, it terminates the pattern). For instance, to search for the string \"/example/\" followed by one or more alphabetic characters, you'd use /\\/example\\/[a-z]+/i \u2014the backslashes before each slash make them literal. To match a literal backslash, you need to escape the backslash. For instance, to match the string \"C:\\\" where \"C\" can be any letter, you'd use /[A-Z]:\\\\/ \u2014 the first backslash escapes the one after it, so the expression searches for a single literal backslash. If using the RegExp constructor with a string literal, remember that the backslash is an escape in string literals, so to use it in the regular expression, you need to escape it at the string literal level. /a\\*b/ and new RegExp(\"a\\\\*b\") create the same expression, which searches for \"a\" followed by a literal \"*\" followed by \"b\". If escape strings are not already part of your pattern you can add them using String.replace : function escapeRegExp(string) { return string.replace(/[.*+?^ ${ }() | [ \\ ] \\\\ ] / g , ' \\\\ $&' ); } The \"g\" after the regular expression is an option or flag that performs a global search, looking in the whole string and returning all matches. It is explained in detail below in Advanced Searching With Flags . Why isn't this built into JavaScript? There is a proposal to add such a function to RegExp, but it was rejected by TC39. Using parentheses \u2691 Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern causes that part of the matched substring to be remembered. Once remembered, the substring can be recalled for other use. See Groups and ranges for more details. Using regular expressions in JavaScript \u2691 Regular expressions are used with the RegExp methods test() and exec() and with the String methods match() , replace() , search() , and split() . These methods are explained in detail in the JavaScript reference . Method Description exec() Executes a search for a match in a string. It returns an array of information or null on a mismatch. test() Tests for a match in a string. It returns true or false . match() Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or null if no match is found. matchAll() Returns an iterator containing all of the matches, including capturing groups. search() Tests for a match in a string. It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails. replace() Executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring. replaceAll() Executes a search for all matches in a string, and replaces the matched substrings with a replacement substring. split() Uses a regular expression or a fixed string to break a string into an array of substrings. When you want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, use the test() or search() methods; for more information (but slower execution) use the exec() or match() methods. If you use exec() or match() and if the match succeeds, these methods return an array and update properties of the associated regular expression object and also of the predefined regular expression object, RegExp . If the match fails, the exec() method returns null (which coerces to false ). In the following example, the script uses the exec() method to find a match in a string. var myRe = / d ( b + ) d / g ; var myArray = myRe . exec ( 'cdbbdbsbz' ); If you do not need to access the properties of the regular expression, an alternative way of creating myArray is with this script: var myArray = / d ( b + ) d / g . exec ( 'cdbbdbsbz' ); (See Using the global search flag with exec() for further info about the different behaviors.) If you want to construct the regular expression from a string, yet another alternative is this script: var myRe = new RegExp ( 'd(b+)d' , 'g' ); var myArray = myRe . exec ( 'cdbbdbsbz' ); With these scripts, the match succeeds and returns the array and updates the properties shown in the following table. Results of regular expression execution. Object Property or index Description In this example myArray The matched string and all remembered substrings. ['dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz'] index The 0-based index of the match in the input string. 1 input The original string. 'cdbbdbsbz' [0] The last matched characters. 'dbbd' myRe lastIndex The index at which to start the next match. (This property is set only if the regular expression uses the g option, described in Advanced Searching With Flags .) 5 source The text of the pattern. Updated at the time that the regular expression is created, not executed. 'd(b+)d' As shown in the second form of this example, you can use a regular expression created with an object initializer without assigning it to a variable. If you do, however, every occurrence is a new regular expression. For this reason, if you use this form without assigning it to a variable, you cannot subsequently access the properties of that regular expression. For example, assume you have this script: var myRe = / d ( b + ) d / g ; var myArray = myRe . exec ( 'cdbbdbsbz' ); console . log ( 'The value of lastIndex is ' + myRe . lastIndex ); However, if you have this script: var myArray = / d ( b + ) d / g . exec ( 'cdbbdbsbz' ); console . log ( 'The value of lastIndex is ' + / d ( b + ) d / g . lastIndex ); The occurrences of /d(b+)d/g in the two statements are different regular expression objects and hence have different values for their lastIndex property. If you need to access the properties of a regular expression created with an object initializer, you should first assign it to a variable. Advanced searching with flags \u2691 Regular expressions have six optional flags that allow for functionality like global and case insensitive searching. These flags can be used separately or together in any order, and are included as part of the regular expression. Flag Description Corresponding property d Generate indices for substring matches. RegExp.prototype.hasIndices g Global search. RegExp.prototype.global i Case-insensitive search. RegExp.prototype.ignoreCase m Multi-line search. RegExp.prototype.multiline s Allows . to match newline characters. RegExp.prototype.dotAll u \"unicode\"; treat a pattern as a sequence of unicode code points. RegExp.prototype.unicode y Perform a \"sticky\" search that matches starting at the current position in the target string. See sticky . RegExp.prototype.sticky To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax: or var re = new RegExp ( 'pattern' , 'flags' ); Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They cannot be added or removed later. For example, re = /\\w+\\s/g creates a regular expression that looks for one or more characters followed by a space, and it looks for this combination throughout the string. var re = / \\ w + \\ s / g ; var str = 'fee fi fo fum' ; var myArray = str . match ( re ); console . log ( myArray ); You could replace the line: with: var re = new RegExp ( ' \\\\ w+ \\\\ s' , 'g' ); and get the same result. The m flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be treated as multiple lines. If the m flag is used, ^ and $ match at the start or end of any line within the input string instead of the start or end of the entire string. Using the global search flag with exec() \u2691 The behavior associated with the g flag is different when the .exec() method is used. The roles of \"class\" and \"argument\" get reversed: In the case of .match() , the string class (or data type) owns the method and the regular expression is just an argument, while in the case of .exec() , it is the regular expression that owns the method, with the string being the argument. Contrast this str.match(re) versus re.exec(str) . The g flag is used with the .exec() method to get iterative progression. var xArray ; while ( xArray = re . exec ( str )) console . log ( xArray ); Examples \u2691 Note: Several examples are also available in: The reference pages for exec() , test() , match() , matchAll() , search() , replace() , split() This guide articles': character classes , assertions , groups and ranges , quantifiers , Unicode property escapes Using special characters to verify input \u2691 In the following example, the user is expected to enter a phone number. When the user presses the \"Check\" button, the script checks the validity of the number. If the number is valid (matches the character sequence specified by the regular expression), the script shows a message thanking the user and confirming the number. If the number is invalid, the script informs the user that the phone number is not valid. The regular expression looks for: three numeric characters \\d{3} OR | a left parenthesis \\( , followed by three digits \\d{3} , followed by a close parenthesis \\) , in a non-capturing group (?:) followed by one dash, forward slash, or decimal point in a capturing group () followed by three digits \\d{3} followed by the match remembered in the (first) captured group \\1 followed by four digits \\d{4} The click event activated when the user presses Enter sets the value of phoneInput.value . HTML \u2691 <p> Enter your phone number (with area code) and then click \"Check\". <br> The expected format is like ###-###-####. </p> <form action= \"#\" onSubmit= \"return false\" > <input id= \"phone\" > <button onClick= \"testInfo(document.querySelector('#phone'));\" > Check </button> </form> <p id= \"out\" ></p> JavaScript \u2691 var re = / ( ? : \\ d { 3 } | \\ ( \\ d { 3 } \\ ))([ - \\ / \\ . ]) \\ d { 3 } \\ 1 \\ d { 4 } / ; function testInfo ( phoneInput ) { var OK = re . exec ( phoneInput . value ); var out = document . querySelector ( '#out' ); if ( ! OK ) { out . textContent = ` $ { phoneInput . value } isn 't a phone number with area code!`; } else { out . textContent = ` Thanks , your phone number is $ { OK [ 0 ]} ` ; } } Result \u2691 Links: [[../1-Maps-of-Content/020 - Development.md]] | [[../1-Maps-of-Content/MOC - Web Development.md]] | [[Regular Expressions]] | Javascript.md Sources: Regular expressions - JavaScript | MDN (mozilla.org)","title":"Regular expressions - JavaScript - MDN"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Regular%20expressions%20-%20JavaScript%20-%20MDN/#regular-expressions-javascript-mdn","text":"","title":"Regular expressions - JavaScript - MDN"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Regular%20expressions%20-%20JavaScript%20-%20MDN/#creating-a-regular-expression","text":"You construct a regular expression in one of two ways: Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows: Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded.

For this reason, if you use this form without assigning it to a variable, you cannot subsequently access the properties of that regular expression. For example, assume you have this script: var myRe = / d ( b + ) d / g ; var myArray = myRe . exec ( 'cdbbdbsbz' ); console . log ( 'The value of lastIndex is ' + myRe . lastIndex ); However, if you have this script: var myArray = / d ( b + ) d / g . exec ( 'cdbbdbsbz' ); console . log ( 'The value of lastIndex is ' + / d ( b + ) d / g . lastIndex ); The occurrences of /d(b+)d/g in the two statements are different regular expression objects and hence have different values for their lastIndex property. If you need to access the properties of a regular expression created with an object initializer, you should first assign it to a variable.","title":"Using regular expressions in JavaScript"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Regular%20expressions%20-%20JavaScript%20-%20MDN/#advanced-searching-with-flags","text":"Regular expressions have six optional flags that allow for functionality like global and case insensitive searching. These flags can be used separately or together in any order, and are included as part of the regular expression. Flag Description Corresponding property d Generate indices for substring matches. RegExp.prototype.hasIndices g Global search. RegExp.prototype.global i Case-insensitive search. RegExp.prototype.ignoreCase m Multi-line search. RegExp.prototype.multiline s Allows . to match newline characters. RegExp.prototype.dotAll u \"unicode\"; treat a pattern as a sequence of unicode code points. RegExp.prototype.unicode y Perform a \"sticky\" search that matches starting at the current position in the target string. See sticky . RegExp.prototype.sticky To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax: or var re = new RegExp ( 'pattern' , 'flags' ); Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They cannot be added or removed later. For example, re = /\\w+\\s/g creates a regular expression that looks for one or more characters followed by a space, and it looks for this combination throughout the string. var re = / \\ w + \\ s / g ; var str = 'fee fi fo fum' ; var myArray = str . match ( re ); console . log ( myArray ); You could replace the line: with: var re = new RegExp ( ' \\\\ w+ \\\\ s' , 'g' ); and get the same result. The m flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be treated as multiple lines. If the m flag is used, ^ and $ match at the start or end of any line within the input string instead of the start or end of the entire string.","title":"Advanced searching with flags"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Regular%20expressions%20-%20JavaScript%20-%20MDN/#using-the-global-search-flag-with-exec","text":"The behavior associated with the g flag is different when the .exec() method is used.

Contrast this str.match(re) versus re.exec(str) .

DISM can be used to service a Windows image (.wim) or a virtual hard disk (.vhd or.vhdx). The Component store is a core feature of Windows 10 which stores all of the files related to the OS grouped by components and as hardlinks. With new servicing model introduced in Vista, some system files are shared between two components and they are all hardlinked to the system32 folder. When the OS is serviced, the component store is updated. The Component Store is part of the Windows Imaging and Servicing stack. There is a special console tool called DISM which ships with Windows 10 by default. It can be used to fix Windows Component Store corruption. It is especially useful when the usual command \" sfc /scannow \" cannot repair damaged system files.

Review Work Processes 8. Check your Dependencies 9. Time for Overtime? 10. Keep Managing It happens to projects big and small: one day, you wake up to a mess in your workspace. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a colleague who can\u2019t load-balance, or a budget decision that left you with fewer resources. And in a certain sense, it doesn\u2019t matter why the project got off track \u2013 but it definitely matters how you untangle it. 1. Recognize Warning Signs and Act Fast \u2691 Project snags don\u2019t magically resolve themselves. The earlier you face these problems in the project\u2019s lifecycle, the more options you have to resolve them. Throughout the life of the project, get regular status updates. Encourage your team to forecast their remaining work, factoring in any project plan changes so that potential slippages are identified as soon as possible. Use collaborative project management software to keep everyone clear on where the project\u2014and their responsibilities\u2014stands at all times. 2. Find Out What\u2019s Gone Wrong \u2691 Don\u2019t rush into a fix without first identifying why. Without taking the time to understand the root cause of the problem, any proposed solution will be a shot in the dark. Start by talking to your team. Get their view on what\u2019s hot and what\u2019s not, and elicit their ideas for a solution. Your team\u2019s engagement and commitment to any new plan going forward will be the critical contributor to its success. And a heads-up: When the going gets tough, these information-gathering exercises can deteriorate into finger-pointing sessions so don\u2019t let that happen. Instead, press for accurate information on how to reprioritize and restructure tasks. Team members might be reticent when it comes to delivering bad news and may choose to do so in bits and pieces. Be clear that you need all of the bad news right now, otherwise you\u2019ll be re-structuring the plan every week as the news rolls in incrementally. Be sure to share what you find so that subsequent chaotic projects don\u2019t suffer the same issues. 3. Revisit the Original Plan \u2691 Don\u2019t forget why you\u2019re doing the project in the first place. Review the original business case and check in from time to time to verify that it\u2019s still valid. It\u2019s easy to focus on doing whatever\u2019s needed to hit that next deadline, but be aware of what that mono-focusing does to the overall project (and the consequences it has on any projects that follow). You might be able to hit that deadline by throwing additional resources at it, but if this plan trashes the overall budget and subsequent delivery schedules, then that\u2019s not the way to go. You want to play the long game here. Don\u2019t be afraid to consider the effects of killing the chaotic project and walking away. In reality, this is rarely an option as it can be devastating in terms of customer relations and company reputation, but you should always weigh it up. A dogged determination to see a project through is admirable, but if it makes you unable to deliver on other commitments, it can be catastrophic for your organization. Review the financial and your resources against the overall business plan. If the chaotic project isn\u2019t going to deliver what it set out to do, then look at how you can really get there at this point in the project. 4. Review Your Resources \u2691 When scheduling issues occur, it\u2019s easy (and common practice) to simply throw extra bodies at the chaotic project and grow the team. But this rarely yields a great result. Instead, when your project hits a speed bump, consider the following options to get your project back on track: Make sure the right people are assigned to the right tasks. You might have to do some re-delegating and re-allocating. See if you can spread portions of a meaty task among a larger team so that more tasks can be worked on in parallel rather than serially. Identify team members that you can shift from non-critical work to critical path activities. Focus on competency, not availability. Add resources with the right experience and skills so they can hit the ground running. 5. Look for new Solutions \u2691 Look at the project scope, and ask yourself: Is there anything planned that doesn\u2019t need to be here? Are there any activities or deliverables being added or gold-plated that could be dropped or scaled back without falling short of the original requirement? (A zero-tolerance approach to scope creep can often save the day). A note of caution: When re-planning or re-prioritizing, be wary of sacrificing quality for expediency. Time can often be saved by cutting test and validation activities, but this is a false economy as you\u2019ll end up doing the work later, post-delivery. And then it will be even costlier. Review the planned deliverables and activities and strip out the non-essentials. 6. Talk to your Client \u2691 None of us likes to share our woes with our clients, but if the relationship is sound, your client will work with you to find a solution. Get a dialogue going and develop a workable plan. Start by changing parts of the plan with your client, like the delivery schedule, or agreed-upon delivery phases, rather than overhauling the one big deadline. Who knows\u2014you might be able to extend the overall schedule but still get your client the key deliverables when they need them. 7. Review Work Processes \u2691 We\u2019re creatures of habit. This means we might be prone to keep working on a chaotic project in the same manner we always have because it\u2019s what we\u2019re used to. But when your project\u2019s struggling, it\u2019s time to find a new, creative approach. Start by talking to your team. Let them help you identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and together you can come up with smarter ways to get the work done. Another trick: Review stages are often a sticking point, so if documentation keeps getting bounced from one reviewer to another, schedule a meeting-based review. Get all the players in the room so issues can be ironed out swiftly in one session. 8. Check your Dependencies \u2691 It\u2019s easy to leave some project activities loosely-defined when you\u2019re in the first stages of planning. For example, to be on the safe side you might schedule dependencies serially (e.g., development only starts when a design is fully complete, etc.). But when you\u2019re further down the project road, it\u2019s time to see if some of these tasks and activities can be re-scheduled in a more parallel manner. A word of caution: Be careful of over-doing this fast-tracking. There\u2019s always a chance you\u2019ll have to rework things down the road, but it\u2019s always worth looking at. Also, the client can be the bottleneck if you\u2019re waiting on stakeholder participation in certain events, so communicate what you need and when you need it. Be clear on what impact that any delays will have on delivery. Don\u2019t take all the pain yourself. Identify anything that\u2019s obstructing progress on the project and work with the team to smooth out the bumps. 9. Time for Overtime? \u2691 This is often the first thought when schedules start to flounder. Overtime should be a last resort\u2014turned to when there are few to no other options left as a deadline looms. The strange truth about overtime is that it doesn\u2019t always yield higher levels of productivity. Instead, team members who work long hours over the course of time tend to pace themselves (either consciously or sub-consciously) accordingly. The result is that they end up applying themselves less during the non-overtime hours to save themselves for the overtime portion of their day. To combat this, try laying out a rough draft of a schedule that includes a small amount of overtime, and see if this delivers a schedule that works for the project. If it doesn\u2019t work on paper, it won\u2019t work in practice. 10. Keep Managing \u2691 It\u2019s much easier to manage a team when everything\u2019s going well. But a lot of best practices can go out the window when it\u2019s an all-hands-to-the-pumps situation to keep things afloat. As a project manager, keep talking to the team and make sure everyone is clear on what\u2019s expected of them. Roles and responsibilities can become woolly when a new plan is quickly put in place. Morale can also suffer when things go awry as team members feel they haven\u2019t delivered\u2014or, even if they have, people get discouraged when they\u2019re part of a potentially unsuccessful venture. So, don\u2019t forget to acknowledge what is going well. Check your own behavior. Leading by example, is the most crucial when times are tough.

Review Work Processes"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Taming%20a%20Chaotic%20Project/#8-check-your-dependencies","text":"It\u2019s easy to leave some project activities loosely-defined when you\u2019re in the first stages of planning. For example, to be on the safe side you might schedule dependencies serially (e.g., development only starts when a design is fully complete, etc.). But when you\u2019re further down the project road, it\u2019s time to see if some of these tasks and activities can be re-scheduled in a more parallel manner. A word of caution: Be careful of over-doing this fast-tracking. There\u2019s always a chance you\u2019ll have to rework things down the road, but it\u2019s always worth looking at. Also, the client can be the bottleneck if you\u2019re waiting on stakeholder participation in certain events, so communicate what you need and when you need it. Be clear on what impact that any delays will have on delivery. Don\u2019t take all the pain yourself. Identify anything that\u2019s obstructing progress on the project and work with the team to smooth out the bumps.","title":"8. Check your Dependencies"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Taming%20a%20Chaotic%20Project/#9-time-for-overtime","text":"This is often the first thought when schedules start to flounder. Overtime should be a last resort\u2014turned to when there are few to no other options left as a deadline looms. The strange truth about overtime is that it doesn\u2019t always yield higher levels of productivity. Instead, team members who work long hours over the course of time tend to pace themselves (either consciously or sub-consciously) accordingly. The result is that they end up applying themselves less during the non-overtime hours to save themselves for the overtime portion of their day. To combat this, try laying out a rough draft of a schedule that includes a small amount of overtime, and see if this delivers a schedule that works for the project. If it doesn\u2019t work on paper, it won\u2019t work in practice.","title":"9. Time for Overtime?"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Taming%20a%20Chaotic%20Project/#10-keep-managing","text":"It\u2019s much easier to manage a team when everything\u2019s going well. But a lot of best practices can go out the window when it\u2019s an all-hands-to-the-pumps situation to keep things afloat. As a project manager, keep talking to the team and make sure everyone is clear on what\u2019s expected of them. Roles and responsibilities can become woolly when a new plan is quickly put in place. Morale can also suffer when things go awry as team members feel they haven\u2019t delivered\u2014or, even if they have, people get discouraged when they\u2019re part of a potentially unsuccessful venture. So, don\u2019t forget to acknowledge what is going well. Check your own behavior. Leading by example, is the most crucial when times are tough.

What is it? Public Speaking \u2691 It\u2019s true. No doubt about it. I attest most of my success to a fateful day in 2008 (May 31st to be exact) when I spoke at Desert Code Camp in Phoenix. That was my first public speaking event in a professional setting, ever. The topic? _ Intro to Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control _You can find the slides for that talk right here on slideshare . I\u2019m serious, that\u2019s my first foraye into speaking. The slides are terrible and embarassing, but everyone loved the talk at the time. In fact, the people liked it so much that when I signed up to speak there I was able to see how many people were going to be at my talk in advance. The web app that code camp was using at the time had that feature (it was a different one than Desert Code Camp uses now, but similar). Long story short, my talk went from the \u201csmall classroom\u201d to the medium room, to the large room to the auditorium at a tech college I was speaking at. Fun fact \u2013 the presentation was at UAT to be exact and thats actually where I went to college. I was very familiar with the auditorium and knew how many people it could fit. At the time I went it was 172 people. How many people were there when I presented? Well over 172, there was standing room only and it was one of the most popular talks of the day. This is not a humble brag, but I am actually saying this for the exact opposite reason. I\u2019m saying this because when I got on stage, I was scared shitless . To this day I remember walking on stage and then walking off, going outside, calling my wife and telling her how I did, going home and falling asleep from the sheer exhaustion of stress and terror that I just experienced. I do not remember any of the talk whatsoever. Kind of crazy how the mind will do that to traumatizing events. Terror? Stress? What? Why? You may ask. You had a popular talk. You might think. You\u2019re right, I did. People loved it and I got a lot of professional attention because of it, and it helped my career. The important thing to note here is that this was my first professional talk, ever. The most people I\u2019d ever spoken in front of prior to that event was maybe 10-12 people, and that was during a work lunch when you go around the table and talk about something (such as a team building event). 172+ people? ABSOLUTE TERROR, PANIC & FEAR. The thing is, public speaking has often been rated in many publications as the one thing people fear far more than death itself. Thats a pretty bold statement. More than death itself? I don\u2019t know about you, but I love life. Sure, its full of stressors and other things that are out of my hands at time, but I love being alive. I\u2019d much rather get in front of people and talk than die. But \u2026 thats the reality of the situation \u2013 people are scared to get in front of crowds and speak. So scared that they\u2019d rather die. Think about how many people you know that say \u201cOMG, there is now way I could do that, I\u2019d die\u201d. Yeah. Exactly. That one day led to many job offers eventually. Not just full time offers but consulting offers and offers to do bigger and better things. From speaking I ventured deeper into blogging and then into more writing in general. I kept speaking and eventually got noticed by some consutlingn firms. I worked for them for awhile and kept speaking as well. Companies usually love when you speak in public. You\u2019re a public face of their company (in this case, part of the engineering deparment). Eventually I got enough offers for external contract jobs that I decided to jump and go work for myself as a consultant. I did that six years ago in 2009. I went full time independent consulting. How? All from speaking. If I had never got in front of people and spoke about what I knew I\u2019d never be in the situation I\u2019m in now. I\u2019m foreever grateful to those who gave me the opporutnity to speak, to hire me and to bring me on to help their team. Thank you. Fast forward many years later from my initial speaking engagement and I\u2019ve now spoken to crowds of 400-500 people at times with no fear. As with anything \u2013 the more you do it, the better you get at it and eventually you actually kind of get used to it. I challenge you to go out and speak. Find a local user group, a code camp, a meet-up of some sort. Just go out and share your knowledge. Don\u2019t be scared. Will you know everything? No. Will there be someone in the crowd who knows more than you? Yes. Regardless, you need to get out there and do it. You\u2019ll be glad you did. It will open doors you never knew existed.

If you\u2019re doing some manipulation to get a quick answer between R and Excel, these functions can come in handy. readClipboard reads in whatever is currently on the Clipboard. For example, let\u2019s copy a column of cells from Excel. We can now run readClipboard() in R. The result of running this command is a vector containing the column of cells we just copied. Each cell corresponds to an element in the vector. Similarly, if we want to write a vector of elements to the clipboard, we can the writeClipboard command: test <- c ( \"write\" , \"to\" , \"clipboard\" ) writeClipboard ( test ) Now, the vector test has been copied to the clipboard. If you paste the result in Excel, you\u2019ll see a column of cells corresponding to the vector you just copied. combn \u2691 The combn function is useful for getting the possible combinations of an input vector. For instance, let\u2019s say we want to get all of the possible 2-element combinations of a vector, we could do this: food <- c ( \"apple\" , \"grape\" , \"orange\" , \"pear\" , \"peach\" , \"banana\" ) combn ( food , 2 ) In general, the first parameter of combn is the vector of elements you want to get possible combinations from. The second parameter is the number of elements you want in each combination. So if you need to get all possible 3-element or 4-element combinations, you would just need to change this number to three or four. combn(food, 3) combn(food, 4) We can also add a parameter called simplify to make the function return a list of each combination, rather than giving back a matrix output like above. combn(food, 3, simplify = FALSE) fileSnapshot \u2691 The fileSnapshot function is one R\u2019s collection of file manipulation functions. To learn more about file manipulation and getting information on files in R, check out this post . fileSnapshot will list and provide details about the files in a directory. This function returns a list of objects. # get file snapshot of current directory snapshot <- fileSnapshot () # or file snapshot of another directory snapshot <- fileSnapshot ( \"C:/some/other/directory\" ) fileSnapshot returns a list, which here we will just call \u201csnapshot\u201d. The most useful piece of information can be garnered from this by referencing \u201cinfo\u201d: snapshot$info Here, snapshot$info is a data frame showing information about the files in the input folder parameter. Its headers include: size ==> size of file isdir ==> is file a directory? ==> TRUE or FALSE mode ==> the file permissions in octal mtime ==> last modified time stamp ctime ==> time stamp created atime ==> time stamp last accessed exe ==> type of executable (or \u201cno\u201d if not an executable) download.file \u2691 download.file does just what it sounds like \u2013 downloads a file from the internet to the destination provided in the function\u2019s input.

Views \u2691 Normal views have their own advantages and disadvantages in comparison to materialized views . A view is created with the Create View SQL command and contains all data obtained from the supplied view query expression. A primary advantage of views is that you can query them in the same manner as you would any normal database schema's table and retrieve the latest updated calculated results. The key here is that views always compute every time they are queried or accessed in any way; which may be seen as both a pro and con. Another side-note is that in the circumstance you make any type of update to the content in a View, it will always be \u201cpushed back\u201d and updated in the original table. Likewise, the reverse is also true: any changes that are made to the original base table are instantly reflected in the View. What this means, however, is that the performance of a View will always be slower than that of a materialized view. The major advantage is that a View doesn\u2019t actually require storage space. You can also have total control over which users can or cannot view sensitive information within the database itself. A materialized view, on the other hand, is a physical copy of those original base tables. Think of it more like a photograph of the original base table.

It\u2019s what comes after \u201c@\u201d in an email address, or after \u201cwww.\u201d in a web address. If someone asks how to find you online, what you tell them is usually your domain name. Examples of domain names are: google.com wikipedia.org youtube.com The first step in creating an online presence is purchasing a domain name. Anyone can purchase a domain name by going to a domain host or registrar like Google Domains, finding a name no one else is using, and paying an annual fee to own and register it. You can also choose from various domain name endings (or \u201cTLDs\u201d), like .com, .coffee, or .photography. If you\u2019re thinking about buying a domain name, check out our tips on how to come up with a good name . A domain name, website, and URL are not the same thing. URL \u2691 A URL (aka Universal Resource Locator) is a complete web address used to find a particular web page. While the domain is the name of the website, a URL will lead to any one of the pages within the website. Every URL contains a domain name, as well as other components needed to locate the specific page or piece of content. Examples of URLs: http://www.google.com https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/umami https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending Website \u2691 Though one leads to the other, buying a domain name doesn\u2019t mean you have a website. A domain is the name of a website, a URL is how to find a website, and a website is what people see and interact with when they get there. In other words, when you buy a domain, you have purchased the name for your site, but you still need to build the website itself. In digital terms, a website is a collection of content, often on multiple pages, that is grouped together under the same domain. You can think of it like a store, where the domain is the store name, the URL is the store address, and the website is the actual store, with shelves full of products and a cash register. Luckily, building a website is much easier, faster, and more economical than building a physical store or office. Today, there are many great companies who make it possible for anyone to build a beautiful, professional-looking website in just a few hours\u2014and most don\u2019t require any knowledge of coding or design. To learn more about building your site, check out our post on how to choose a website builder . In order to create a website, you need a few things: A domain name (such as yoursite.com) A domain registrar and host (such as Google Domains) A do-it-yourself website builder, like SquareSpace or Wix, or a web designer Digital content\u2014the text, images, videos, and other media that visitors will see when they come to your site. Domain registrar \u2691 A domain registrar is a company that sells domain names that aren't currently owned and are available for you to register. A simple search on a domain registrar\u2019s page should tell you if the domain name you want is available and how much it will cost. DNS host \u2691 A DNS host is a company that manages your domain's configuration (also known as DNS resource records) that makes sure your domain name points to your website and email. Most domain hosts also offer domain name registration. Domain registrars should offer privacy protection for free. WHOIS and RDAP directories \u2691 The WHOIS and RDAP directories are public listings of domain names and the people or organizations associated with each name. You can use the directory to find domain owners and IP addresses, as well as mailing addresses and telephone numbers. For privacy, some domain name owners choose to hide their personal information from these directories, just as you might want your personal telephone number to be unlisted in a telephone book. Now you know the difference between basic web terms, and how they all play a part in creating a web presence for businesses and brands.

The question that pops up next is usually \u2026 What blog platform should I use? [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/Medium.md]]? [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/WordPress.md]]? [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/Gatsby.md]]? [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/Jekyll.md]]? Or something else? This is a HUGELY important question that needs a bit of thought put into it \u2026 but first things first \u2026 You Need to [[Focus on Writing]] \u2691 Before I get into comparing the vast array of options that you have out there I want to state that if your goal is to start bogging then \u2026. ==YOU SHOULD NOT BE FOCUSING ON BUILDING SOFTWARE TO RUN A BLOG== ==In other words, if you\u2019re a software engineer (and some of you are) you should not get consumed with \u201cbuilding my blog\u201d with some latest and greatest technology that you can learn along the way.== If your goal is to write \u2026. Then put your ego away and start writing. If your goal is to learn a new technology then stop reading this and go learn a new technology. Far too often I see software folks lose all of their time \u201cbuilding\u201d something like a blog with technology X, Y and Z and then never ship a blog post because they were too busy optimizing [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/CSS.md]], [[../0-Inbox/Placeholders/HTML.md]], Javascript.md , [[deployment]] methods with integrated [[CICD pipelines]]. ==All of that is a waste of time if your goal is to start writing a blog.== ==So focus on writing \u2013 not on building a blog engine.== Choosing a Platform \u2691 ==Choosing a platform can turn into a serious case of analysis paralysis. I hope to solve that for you today by comparing some of the top platforms and what they have to offer (on the good and bad front).== At this time I\u2019m going to compare the following blog systems that you can use. Medium WordPress Ghost Static Site Generators Jekyll Gatsby etc. I\u2019m not going to cover SquareSpace, Wix or Blogger or any of those because I don\u2019t feel they\u2019re in the top three choices for the folks that read this blog (mainly software engineers and entrepreneurs). Medium \u2691 ==Everyone loves Medium because it\u2019s drop dead simple to get started with blogging. You can sign up for a free account and then start writing in their editor in less than a minute.== The tooling that they have is top notch. The editor is gorgeous and they make it really simple to craft your content quickly. They also have a very powerful recommendation engine for readers. Meaning that if you have a blog on Dog Grooming and you write about Dog Shampoos then another reader who is reading another dog blog about walking dogs (on Medium) then there is a very high chance that Medium will recommend your article to them to read next. Again this is only for other blogs on Medium. Medium will not recommend other sites to visit for you to find similar content. Just doesn\u2019t work way. The power of their network recommendation engines for exposing your content to others is fantastic. However, that\u2019s where the great news comes to a close. Medium has more downfalls than positives in my opinion: You have no ability to customize your blog. You CANNOT ADD features like: Custom Domains Email sign up forms Payment forms Customized landing pages Contact pages Custom integrations Etc I could write a small book about things I don\u2019t like about Medium. Lastly, and most importantly, if your content is on Medium \u2013 You are the product. \u2691 Meaning that Medium is using YOU as their product to sell other services. Medium is using YOUR content as a way to recommend other things to other viewers. Medium is using your content as a place for them to throw up their pay wall to get folks to convert to paid members. They own everything on the site and can do that they want with it (to an extent of course). Lastly, one of the things that REALLY bugs me about Medium is that you cannot have your own domain (they use allow this, but not anymore). That means your blog will be medium.com/@yourusername So \u2026 that's kind of lame. That's like having a business and then printing your AOL email address on your business card. In other words \u2013 it looks like shit it makes you and your brand look half-assed. That said, Medium is simply a \u201ceasy to get going\u201d blog. Game over. PROS Super simple to get started Gorgeous editor Great Recommendation Engine CONS You are their product No custom domains, have to use the ugly medium.com/@yourusername format No ability to provide landing pages, payments, custom pages, forms, opt-in, etc Locked into their platform Integrations are poor WordPress \u2691 WordPress is the 800 pound gorilla in the blogging world (and internet in general). It has been reported that WordPress powers over 1/3 of the internet . That's wild. That\u2019s a lot of sites. Apparently WordPress is doing something right. To get set up with WordPress, you have a couple of options: Host on WordPress.com (they manage it) Self host or managed hosting. Hosting on WordPress.com makes it easy to get going, but you\u2019re limited because WordPress.com restricts certain plugins from being installed or utilized and there are a few other restrictions. Therefore I\u2019m going to focus on the self-hosted or managed hosting solution. I\u2019ll provide some links for self hosting and and managed solutions below. Sure, you\u2019ll pay a few bucks, but it\u2019s worth its weight in gold. WordPress is very powerful. You can build a blog to a full blow website using WordPress. In this instance you will be building a blog. You can use one of the built in themes or you can search for free themes on the internet (you can also search for premium themes if you don\u2019t mind spending a few bucks). I recommend searching for \u201c WordPress Themes \u201d or \u201c Free WordPress Themes \u201d or \u201c https://www.google.com/search?q=premium+wordpress+themes \u201d if you\u2019re searching online. One of the best things about WordPress is the powerful plugin ecosystem. There are hundreds of thousands of plugins for WordPress. If you can think of it, its very possible a plugin has been created for WordPress. Plugins allow you to quickly add new features to your blog/site without any additional coding. With a WordPress plugin you\u2019ll be able to easily add email newsletter option support by adding of any number of email plugins that will allow you to do that. (You may need a email list provider already, such as ConvertKit, MailChimp, etc) but the plugins will be there for you to easily add it to the side bar or bottom/top of your site. You can create custom pages to house custom content that is perhaps not a blog post, but something like a landing page where you decide you sell a product. Speaking of selling things, you can sell products on WordPress if you use one of the premium plugins like WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads . If you think about doing something down the line, most likely it can already be done with WordPress. Writing in WordPress is drop dead simple too. You create a new post, give it a title and write your blog post as you normally would. Add images, audio, video, etc all via the online editor that is built into WordPress. Hit publish and you\u2019re live. Hosting WordPress \u2691 I recommend using managed solution to handle your WordPress installation. I\u2019ve tried running my own servers and then moved over to managed hosting years ago and I highly recommend it. I recommend using a hosted solution such as: WpEngine FlyWheel What about GoDaddy? Meh. GoDaddy overloads their servers with other sites which can be a real problem when your site needs to be responsive. WpEngine and FlyWheel have great response times and have fast servers and don\u2019t overload you with other folks. If you have a problem with anything you can reach out to them and they\u2019ll help you. I\u2019ve even had WpEngine representatives write some code for me to fix a particular image problem I had with their CDN \u2013 which brings up a good point. All of their images are stored on a CDN and delivered globally \u2013 making your site load that much faster. Lastly, since you\u2019ll be running your own blog you can have your own custom domain. PROS Simple to setup with a managed host A huge plugin ecosystem Very customizable Good Editor Supports Custom Domains CONS You have to pay money to host it It can get slow if you over load your site with plugins Often targeted by hackers because of how popular it is (if you stay with a managed host, like WpEngine they do a great job of keeping you up to date with security releases.) Ghost \u2691 Ghost is another open source platform that is similar to WordPress but built on completely different technology. One of the biggest selling points of Ghost is that it\u2019s fast. The editor is simple and is very easy to use and you\u2019ll find yourself creating some great looking pages quickly. Ghost also offers a set of plugins, but it does not match the breadth of WordPress and that\u2019s a downfall. Hosting Ghost \u2691 Installation is where you\u2019ll get stuck because you either need to install it yourself or host it. I\u2019ll focus on hosting it. At this point I\u2019d only feel comfortable hosting on Ghost\u2019s platform ( Ghost(Pro) Pricing \u2013 Hosting from the creators of Ghost \u2013 Ghost.org ) as they have the necessary skills to ensure that it runs correctly. I\u2019d be skeptical that it would run correction or efficiently on another hosting platform. Custom domains are also supported, which is great. PROS Simple to setup with a managed host A growing plugin ecosystem Good Editor CONS You have to pay $$ for managed hosting Customization options are limited Gatsby/Jekyll/Hugo/Etc \u2691 This section is meant to cover all static sites. Static sites don\u2019t have a database and render pure HTML to the browser. This typically results in a site that is very fast with minimal configuration and can scale very well due to demand. While these benefits sounds great there are a lot of downfalls. Unfortunately you need to learn a templating language (such as markdown or something else). You\u2019ll often need to work with HTML/CSS and perhaps some JavaScript. If you\u2019re a coder, then this might be something that is interesting to you. Otherwise, this is something you\u2019ll ant to avoid. However, it is important to remember that the point of the blog is so that you can start writing, not create software to render the blog. If you find yourself writing HTML/_CSS/_JavasScript to render you\u2019re writing \u2026 well \u2026 what are you really doing then? Static sites do offer a lot of flexibility though. You can code them to do whatever you want. Want a payment form? Code it. Want a email opt-inform? Code it. Want an Image Gallery? Code it. Sure, there are other tools that you could use to provide this functionality, and you should evaluate those \u2026 but you get the point\u2026 a static site through one of the many static site generators. The real rub here is that your blog is going to be written in a text editor. You typically do not get a great editor to write your blog in. Furthermore, very often you\u2019ll need to \u201ccompile\u201d your pages so that they\u2019re read to go on the web. Once again, you\u2019ll need some technical prowess to handle this. Hosting a Static Site \u2691 Hosting a static site requires that you have a place to put the files. Typically this can be done on a web server, Amazon S3, GitHub pages, or through other services like Nelify and Zeit. You will need some technical know how in order to set these up (which is beyond the scope of this article). As you can imagine, since Gatsby is very customizable and can be hosted anywhere (it\u2019s just HTML) you will be able to use a custom domain. PROS Very customizable Very fast (response times) Can Scale to many viewers due to it being raw html CONS Hosting is not simple Most likely need to know how to code Spend more time configuring the site and writing (most likely, yes I\u2019m pointing at you engineers). Technical Prowess is needed to fully use the platform So, Which One Should I Use? \u2691 WordPress. ==WordPress is the market leader for these types of sites (blogs). It has a rich plugin ecosystem that will be ready for you to grow when you need it and hosting with companies like WpEngine ensure your website is fast and secure. You\u2019ll find that as you need more from WordPress, it can offer almost anything you need. Last piece of advice \u2013 try to build everything without code first. WordPress allowed me to do that. It forced me to focus on my content and not on some cool engineering that ultimately would have acted as a distraction.== But \u2026 Can I go from X to WordPress if I like X better initially? \u2691 Sure, you can, but here again, if you decide to go to WordPress later you\u2019re going to have to spend time migrating from one platform to another. If your goal is to write, why would you want to create more work for yourself? Just go with WordPress now and save yourself the trouble. \ud83d\udcf8 Andrew Neel Links: Dann Felker.md | Highlights - What Blog Platform Should I Use Sources: What Blog Platform Should I Use? - DONN FELKER","title":"What Blog Platform Should I Use"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/What%20Blog%20Platform%20Should%20I%20Use/#what-blog-platform-should-i-use","text":"In a very recent email I wrote about how you need to have a blog.

(You may need a email list provider already, such as ConvertKit, MailChimp, etc) but the plugins will be there for you to easily add it to the side bar or bottom/top of your site. You can create custom pages to house custom content that is perhaps not a blog post, but something like a landing page where you decide you sell a product. Speaking of selling things, you can sell products on WordPress if you use one of the premium plugins like WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads . If you think about doing something down the line, most likely it can already be done with WordPress. Writing in WordPress is drop dead simple too. You create a new post, give it a title and write your blog post as you normally would. Add images, audio, video, etc all via the online editor that is built into WordPress. Hit publish and you\u2019re live.","title":"WordPress"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/What%20Blog%20Platform%20Should%20I%20Use/#hosting-wordpress","text":"I recommend using managed solution to handle your WordPress installation.

WpEngine and FlyWheel have great response times and have fast servers and don\u2019t overload you with other folks. If you have a problem with anything you can reach out to them and they\u2019ll help you. I\u2019ve even had WpEngine representatives write some code for me to fix a particular image problem I had with their CDN \u2013 which brings up a good point.

Static sites don\u2019t have a database and render pure HTML to the browser. This typically results in a site that is very fast with minimal configuration and can scale very well due to demand. While these benefits sounds great there are a lot of downfalls. Unfortunately you need to learn a templating language (such as markdown or something else). You\u2019ll often need to work with HTML/CSS and perhaps some JavaScript. If you\u2019re a coder, then this might be something that is interesting to you. Otherwise, this is something you\u2019ll ant to avoid. However, it is important to remember that the point of the blog is so that you can start writing, not create software to render the blog.

You can code them to do whatever you want. Want a payment form? Code it. Want a email opt-inform? Code it. Want an Image Gallery? Code it. Sure, there are other tools that you could use to provide this functionality, and you should evaluate those \u2026 but you get the point\u2026 a static site through one of the many static site generators.

I had written a software as a service (SaaS) web application to manage members of small boutique gyms. Targeted to CrossFit gyms and functional fitness gyms. The software had the tagline of: The fastest way to accept payments and memberships for your CrossFit or boutique gym. It worked, and it worked well. The problem was that all the solutions out there were complicated, charged setup fees, and were honestly just a pain to use. I knew I could fix that problem, and I did. Within 5 minutes, a gym owner could sign up and set up their gym on the platform. They could easily add a new member in their system with credit card payments and everything. They could perform \u201cone-off\u201d charges as well. One-off charges were manually entered transactions for items that gyms sell (such as shirts, etc). The software was simple and purposely lacked high-end features. In fact, that was its key feature \u2013 its simplicity.

Features Microsoft Command Prompt is a command-line interpreter (CLI) for the Windows operating systems. A CLI is program intended primarily to read operating system instructions typed on a keyboard by the user. It is therefore addressed also as a command-line interface , to contrast it with graphical interfaces. As these interfaces (whether textual or graphical) shield the user from directly accessing to the operating system kernel, they are also said shells . Given the name of the Command Prompt executable file, cmd.exe , the Command Prompt is friendly named cmd . Given its OS piloting role, it is also said the console . Like other shells, cmd can read batch of instructions from a file. In this case the cmd shell acts as a language interpreter and the file content can be regarded as an actual program. When executing these batch programs, there is no intermediate compilation phase. They are typically read, interpreted and executed line by line. Since there is no compilation, there is no production of a separated executable file. For this reason the programs are denoted batch scripts or shell scripts . Note that the instructions entered interactively might have a slightly different syntax from those submitted as a script, but the general principle is that what can be entered from the command line can be also put in a file for later reuse. Hello World Command Prompt batch scripts have extension .cmd or .bat , the latter for compatibility reasons. To create a hello-word-script, you first need a place where to type it. For simple scripts, also the Windows Notepad will do. If you are serious about shell scripting, you need more effective tools. There are anyway several free alternatives, such as Notepad++ . In your designated editor type: echo Hello World pause Save it as hello.cmd If you are using \"Notepad\" as an editor, you should pay much attention to the saved name, as Notepad tends to add always a .txt extension to your files, which means that the actual name of your file might be hello.cmd.txt . To avoid this, in the save dialog box: In the File name field enter the name in double quotes, e.g. \"hello.cmd\" In the Save as type field select All Files, instead of the default Text Document option. You may also consider to disable the option \"Hide extension for known file types\" in File Explorer folder view options. In this case, file names are always displayed with their extensions. To execute hello.cmd there are two possibilities. If you are using the Windows graphical shell, just double click on its icon. If you want to use the Command Prompt itself, you must first identify the directory where you saved hello.cmd . In this regard, if you open File Explorer with fas:Windows +E. In the windows listing files, you normally read the name of the directory path containing them. You can therefore identify the directory of hello.cmd . Windows directory names tend to be quite long and typing them is error prone. It is better if you select and copy the directory path in the clipboard for later pasting. The version/year of Windows of course depends on yours. In the the final line, before > , you read the path of the directory which is current. You should make current the directory where your script is. For this reason enter the change directory command cd , using a line similar to the following: cd < dirpath > Instead of <dirpath> , paste the name of the directory you previously copied. To paste the directory path, in Windows 10, you just need to type Ctrl-C, as you would in an editor. For older systems you should be able to do this by right clicking in the cmd window. After entering the command, note that current path, before > , changes accordingly. You can now run your hello script by simply entering: hello Comments Must Know Commands \u2691 Assoc \u2691 Most files in Windows are associated with a specific program that is assigned to open the file by default. At times, remembering these associations can become confusing. You can remind yourself by entering the command assoc to display a full list of file name extensions and program associations. You can also extend the command to change file associations. For example, assoc .txt= will change the file association for text files to whatever program you enter after the equal sign. The Assoc command itself will reveal both the extension names and program names, which will help you properly use this command. In Windows 10, you can view a more user-friendly interface that also lets you change file type associations on the spot. Head to Settings (Windows + I) > Apps > Default apps > Choose default app by file type . Cipher \u2691 Deleting files on a mechanical hard drive doesn't really delete them at all. Instead, it marks the files as no longer accessible and the space they took up as free. The files remain recoverable until the system overwrites them with new data, which can take some time. The cipher command, however, wipes a directory by writing random data to it. To wipe your C drive, for example, you'd use the cipher /w:d command, which will wipe free space on the drive. The command does not overwrite undeleted data, so you will not wipe out files you need by running this command. You can use a host of other cipher commands, however, they are generally redundant with BitLocker enabled versions of Windows . Driverquery \u2691 Drivers remain among the most important software installed on a PC. Improperly configured or missing drivers can cause all sorts of trouble, so its good to have access to a list of what's on your PC. That's exactly what the driverquery command does. You can extend it to driverquery -v to obtain more information, including the directory in which the driver is installed. For best use, I like to pipe the verbose output ( -v ) into a CSV ( -fo \"csv\" ) via: driverquery -v -fo \"csv\" >> My-Drivers.csv File Compare \u2691 You can use this command to identify differences in text between two files. It's particularly useful for writers and programmers trying to find small changes between two versions of a file. Simply type fc and then the directory path and file name of the two files you want to compare. You can also extend the command in several ways. Typing /b compares only binary output, /c disregards the case of text in the comparison, and /l only compares ASCII text. So, for example, you could use the following: fc /l \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\example1.doc\" \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\example2.doc\" The above command compares ASCII text in two word documents. ipconfig \u2691 This command relays the IP address that your computer is currently using. However, if you're behind a router (like most computers today), you'll instead receive the local network address of the router. Still, ipconfig is useful because of its extensions. ipconfig /release followed by ipconfig /renew can force your Windows PC into asking for a new IP address, which is useful if your computer claims one isn't available. You can also use ipconfig /flushdns to refresh your DNS address. These commands are great if the Windows network troubleshooter chokes, which does happen on occasion. Netstat \u2691 Entering the command netstat -an will provide you with a list of currently open ports and related IP addresses. This command will also tell you what state the port is in; listening, established, or closed. This is a great command for when you're trying to troubleshoot devices connected to your PC or when you fear a Trojan infected your system and you're trying to locate a malicious connection. Ping \u2691 Sometimes, you need to know whether or not packets are making it to a specific networked device. That's where ping comes in handy. Typing ping followed by an IP address or web domain will send a series of test packets to the specified address. If they arrive and are returned, you know the device is capable of communicating with your PC; if it fails, you know that there's something blocking communication between the device and your computer. This can help you decide if the root of the issue is an improper configuration or a failure of network hardware. PathPing \u2691 This is a more advanced version of ping that's useful if there are multiple routers between your PC and the device you're testing. Like ping, you use this command by typing pathping followed by the IP address, but unlike ping, pathping also relays some information about the route the test packets take. Tracert \u2691 The tracert command is similar to pathping. Once again, type tracert followed by the IP address or domain you'd like to trace. You'll receive information about each step in the route between your PC and the target. Unlike pathping, however, tracert also tracks how much time (in milliseconds) each hop between servers or devices takes. Powercfg \u2691 Powercfg is a very powerful command for managing and tracking how your computer uses energy. You can use the command powercfg hibernate on and powercfg hibernate off to manage hibernation, and you can also use the command powercfg /a to view the power-saving states currently available on your PC. Another useful command is powercfg /devicequery s1_supported , which displays a list of devices on your computer that support connected standby. When enabled, you can use these devices to bring your computer out of standby, even remotely. You can enable this by selecting the device in Device Manager , opening its properties, going to the Power Management tab, and then checking the Allow this device to wake the computer box. Powercfg /lastwake will show you what device last woke your PC from a sleep state. You can use this command to troubleshoot your PC if it seems to wake from sleep at random. You can use the powercfg /energy command to build a detailed power consumption report for your PC. The report saves to the directory indicated after the command finishes. This report will let you know of any system faults that might increase power consumption, like devices blocking certain sleep modes, or poorly configured to respond to your power management settings. Windows 8 added powercfg /batteryreport , which provides a detailed analysis of battery use, if applicable. Normally output to your Windows user directory, the report provides details about the time and length of charge and discharge cycles, lifetime average battery life, and estimated battery capacity. Shutdown \u2691 Windows 8 introduced the shutdown command that, you guessed it, shuts down your computer . This is, of course, redundant with the already easily accessed shutdown button, but what's not redundant is the shutdown /r /o command, which restarts your PC and launches the Advanced Start Options menu, which is where you can access Safe Mode and Windows recovery utilities. This is useful if you want to restart your computer for troubleshooting purposes. Systeminfo \u2691 This command will give you a detailed configuration overview of your computer. The list covers your operating system and hardware. For example, you can look up the original Windows installation date, the last boot time, your BIOS version, total and available memory, installed hotfixes, network card configurations, and more. Use systeminfo /s followed by the host name of a computer on your local network, to remotely grab the information for that system. This may require additional syntax elements for the domain, user name, and password, like this: systeminfo / s [ host_name ] / u [ domain ] \\ [ user_name ] / p [ user_password ] System File Checker \u2691 System File Checker is an automatic scan and repair tool that focuses on Windows system files. You will need to run the command prompt with administrator privileges and enter the command sfc /scannow . If SFC finds any corrupt or missing files, it will automatically replace them using cached copies kept by Windows for this purpose alone. The command can require a half-hour to run on older notebooks. Tasklist \u2691 You can use the tasklist command to provide a current list of all tasks running on your PC. Though somewhat redundant with Task Manager, the command may sometimes find tasks hidden from view in that utility. There's also a wide range of modifiers. Tasklist -svc shows services related to each task, use tasklist -v to obtain more detail on each task, and tasklist -m will locate DLL files associated with active tasks. These commands are useful for advanced troubleshooting. Our reader Eric noted that you can \"get the name of the executable associated with the particular process ID you're interested in.\" The command for that operation is tasklist | find [process id]. Taskkill \u2691 Tasks that appear in the tasklist command will have an executable and process ID (a four- or five-digit number) associated with them. You can force stop a program using taskkill -im followed by the executable's name, or taskkill -pid followed by the process ID. Again, this is a bit redundant with Task Manager, but you can use it to kill otherwise unresponsive or hidden programs. Chkdsk \u2691 Windows automatically marks your drive for a diagnostic chkdsk scan when symptoms indicate that a local drive has bad sectors, lost clusters, or other logical or physical errors. If you suspect your hard drive is failing, you can manually initiate a scan. The most basic command is chkdsk c: , which will immediately scan the C: drive, without a need to restart the computer. If you add parameters like /f, /r, /x, or /b, such as in chkdsk /f /r /x /b c: , chkdsk will also fix errors, recover data, dismount the drive, or clear the list of bad sectors, respectively. These actions require a reboot, as they can only run with Windows powered down. If you see chkdsk run at startup, let it do its thing. If it gets stuck, however, refer to the chkdsk troubleshooting article . schtasks \u2691 Schtasks is your command prompt access to the Task Scheduler, one of many underrated Windows administrative tools. While you can use the GUI to manage your scheduled tasks, the command prompt lets you copy&paste complex commands to set up multiple similar tasks without having to click through various options. Ultimately, it's much easier to use, once you've committed key parameters to memory. For example, you could schedule your computer to reboot at 11pm every Friday: schtasks /create /sc weekly /d FRI /tn \"auto reboot computer weekly\" /st 23:00 /tr \"shutdown -r -f -t 10\" To complement your weekly reboot, you could schedule tasks to launch specific programs on startup: schtasks /create /sc onstart /tn \"launch Chrome on startup\" /tr \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\Chrome.exe\" To duplicate the above command for different programs, just copy, paste, and modify it as needed.

To get more insight about a specific command use the /? option, e.g. the tree command gives: tree /? > Graphically displays the folder structure of a drive or path . > TREE [ drive :] [path] [/ F ] [/ A ] > / F Display the names of the files in each folder . > / A Use ASCII instead of extended characters . Features Microsoft Command Prompt is a command-line interpreter (CLI) for the Windows operating systems. A CLI is program intended primarily to read operating system instructions typed on a keyboard by the user. It is therefore addressed also as a command-line interface , to contrast it with graphical interfaces. As these interfaces (whether textual or graphical) shield the user from directly accessing to the operating system kernel, they are also said shells . Given the name of the Command Prompt executable file, cmd.exe , the Command Prompt is friendly named cmd . Given its OS piloting role, it is also said the console . Like other shells, cmd can read batch of instructions from a file. In this case the cmd shell acts as a language interpreter and the file content can be regarded as an actual program. When executing these batch programs, there is no intermediate compilation phase. They are typically read, interpreted and executed line by line. Since there is no compilation, there is no production of a separated executable file. For this reason the programs are denoted batch scripts or shell scripts . Note that the instructions entered interactively might have a slightly different syntax from those submitted as a script, but the general principle is that what can be entered from the command line can be also put in a file for later reuse. Hello World Command Prompt batch scripts have extension .cmd or .bat , the latter for compatibility reasons. To create a hello-word-script, you first need a place where to type it. For simple scripts, also the Windows Notepad will do. If you are serious about shell scripting, you need more effective tools. There are anyway several free alternatives, such as Notepad++ . In your designated editor type: echo Hello World pause Save it as hello.cmd If you are using \"Notepad\" as an editor, you should pay much attention to the saved name, as Notepad tends to add always a .txt extension to your files, which means that the actual name of your file might be hello.cmd.txt . To avoid this, in the save dialog box: In the File name field enter the name in double quotes, e.g. \"hello.cmd\" In the Save as type field select All Files, instead of the default Text Document option. You may also consider to disable the option \"Hide extension for known file types\" in File Explorer folder view options. In this case, file names are always displayed with their extensions. To execute hello.cmd there are two possibilities. If you are using the Windows graphical shell, just double click on its icon. If you want to use the Command Prompt itself, you must first identify the directory where you saved hello.cmd . In this regard, if you open File Explorer with fas:Windows +E. In the windows listing files, you normally read the name of the directory path containing them. You can therefore identify the directory of hello.cmd . Windows directory names tend to be quite long and typing them is error prone. It is better if you select and copy the directory path in the clipboard for later pasting. The version/year of Windows of course depends on yours. In the the final line, before > , you read the path of the directory which is current. You should make current the directory where your script is. For this reason enter the change directory command cd , using a line similar to the following: cd < dirpath > Instead of <dirpath> , paste the name of the directory you previously copied. To paste the directory path, in Windows 10, you just need to type Ctrl-C, as you would in an editor. For older systems you should be able to do this by right clicking in the cmd window. After entering the command, note that current path, before > , changes accordingly. You can now run your hello script by simply entering: hello Comments","title":"Command Line - Getting started with CMD"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Windows%20Command%20Line%20Commands%20Overview/#must-know-commands","text":"","title":"Must Know Commands"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/Windows%20Command%20Line%20Commands%20Overview/#assoc","text":"Most files in Windows are associated with a specific program that is assigned to open the file by default. At times, remembering these associations can become confusing. You can remind yourself by entering the command assoc to display a full list of file name extensions and program associations. You can also extend the command to change file associations. For example, assoc .txt= will change the file association for text files to whatever program you enter after the equal sign. The Assoc command itself will reveal both the extension names and program names, which will help you properly use this command. In Windows 10, you can view a more user-friendly interface that also lets you change file type associations on the spot.

Instead, it marks the files as no longer accessible and the space they took up as free. The files remain recoverable until the system overwrites them with new data, which can take some time. The cipher command, however, wipes a directory by writing random data to it. To wipe your C drive, for example, you'd use the cipher /w:d command, which will wipe free space on the drive.

Typing /b compares only binary output, /c disregards the case of text in the comparison, and /l only compares ASCII text.

Another useful command is powercfg /devicequery s1_supported , which displays a list of devices on your computer that support connected standby. When enabled, you can use these devices to bring your computer out of standby, even remotely. You can enable this by selecting the device in Device Manager , opening its properties, going to the Power Management tab, and then checking the Allow this device to wake the computer box. Powercfg /lastwake will show you what device last woke your PC from a sleep state. You can use this command to troubleshoot your PC if it seems to wake from sleep at random. You can use the powercfg /energy command to build a detailed power consumption report for your PC. The report saves to the directory indicated after the command finishes. This report will let you know of any system faults that might increase power consumption, like devices blocking certain sleep modes, or poorly configured to respond to your power management settings.

You can also use the execution alias wt instead. If you built Windows Terminal from the source code on [ GitHub ] ( https :// github . com / microsoft / terminal ), you can open that build using `wtd.exe` or `wtd` . Command line syntax \u2691 The wt command line accepts two types of values: options and commands . Options are a list of flags and other parameters that can control the behavior of the wt command line as a whole. Commands provide the action, or list of actions separated by semicolons, that should be implemented. If no command is specified, then the command is assumed to be new-tab by default. wt [ options ] [ command ; ] To display a help message listing the available command line arguments, enter: wt -h , wt --help , wt -? , or wt /? . Options and commands \u2691 Below is the full list of supported commands and options for the wt command line. Option Description --help , -h , -? , /? Displays the help message. --maximized , -M Launches the terminal maximized. --fullscreen , -F Launches the terminal as full screen. --focus , -f Launches the terminal in the focus mode.

Otherwise , to run your * default * profile settings , just use ` wt cmd `. The ` - D , -- duplicate ` parameter for ` split - pane ` is only available in [ Windows Terminal Preview ] ( https : // aka . ms / terminal - preview ) . Command line argument examples \u2691 Commands may vary slightly depending on which command line you're using. Passing an argument to the default shell \u2691 To start an instance of Windows Terminal and have it execute a command, call wt.exe followed by your command. Here's an example of calling Windows Terminal to pass a ping command argument to echo an IP address: wt ping docs . microsoft . com Here's an example of calling Windows Terminal to open a new tab with a PowerShell command line, confirming to call the Start-Service command, and opening another new tab with Windows Command Prompt open to the /k directory: wt new-tab PowerShell -c Start-Service ; new-tab cmd /k dir Target a specific window \u2691 The ability for the ` -- window , - w ` parameter to accept window names is only available in [ Windows Terminal Preview ] ( https : // aka . ms / terminal - preview ) .

If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running. Open a new profile instance \u2691 To open a new terminal instance, in this case the command will open the profile named \"Ubuntu-18.04\", enter: Command Prompt \u2691 wt -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" PowerShell \u2691 wt -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running. The -p flag is used to specify the Windows Terminal profile that should be opened. Substitute \"Ubuntu-18.04\" with the name of any terminal profile that you have installed. This will always open a new window. Windows Terminal is not yet capable of opening new tabs or panes in an existing instance. Target a directory \u2691 To specify the folder that should be used as the starting directory for the console, in this case the d:\\ directory, enter: Command Prompt \u2691 wt -d d:\\ PowerShell \u2691 wt -d d :\\ Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" -d d: \\ Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running. Multiple tabs \u2691 To open a new terminal instance with multiple tabs, enter: Command Prompt \u2691 wt ; ; PowerShell \u2691 wt `; `; PowerShell uses a semicolon ; to delimit statements. To interpret a semicolon ; as a command delimiter for wt command-line arguments, you need to escape semicolon characters using backticks. PowerShell also has the stop parsing operator (--%), which instructs it to stop interpreting anything after it and just pass it on verbatim.

If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running and the \\; backslash + semicolon separates commands. Multiple panes \u2691 To open a new terminal instance with one tab containing three panes running a Command Prompt profile, a PowerShell profile, and your default profile running a WSL command line, enter: Command Prompt \u2691 wt -p \"Command Prompt\" ; split-pane -p \"Windows PowerShell\" ; split-pane -H wsl.exe PowerShell \u2691 wt -p \"Command Prompt\" `; split-pane -p \"Windows PowerShell\" `; split-pane -H wsl . exe PowerShell uses a semicolon ; to delimit statements. To interpret a semicolon ; as a command delimiter for wt command-line arguments, you need to escape semicolon characters using backticks. PowerShell also has the stop parsing operator (--%), which instructs it to stop interpreting anything after it and just pass it on verbatim. Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" -p \"Command Prompt\" \\; split-pane -p \"Windows PowerShell\" \\; split-pane -H wsl.exe Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running and the \\; backslash + semicolon separates commands. The -H flag (or --horizontal ) indicates that you would like the panes to be split horizontally. The -V flag (or --vertical ) indicates that you would like the panes split vertically. Multiple tabs and panes \u2691 The new-tab and split-pane commands can be sequenced to get multiple tabs, each with split panes. To open a new terminal instance with two tabs, each with two panes running a Command Prompt and a WSL command line, with each tab in a different directory, enter: Command Prompt \u2691 wt -p \"Command Prompt\" ; split-pane -V wsl . exe ; new-tab -d c : \\ ; split-pane -H -d c : \\ wsl . exe PowerShell \u2691 wt -p \"Command Prompt\" `; split-pane -V wsl . exe `; new-tab -d c :\\ `; split-pane -H -d c :\\ wsl . exe PowerShell uses a semicolon ; to delimit statements. To interpret a semicolon ; as a command delimiter for wt command-line arguments, you need to escape semicolon characters using backticks. PowerShell also has the stop parsing operator (--%), which instructs it to stop interpreting anything after it and just pass it on verbatim. Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" -p \"Command Prompt\" \\; split-pane -V wsl.exe \\; new-tab -d c: \\\\ \\; split-pane -H -d c: \\\\ wsl.exe Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running and the \\; backslash + semicolon separates commands. Note to specify a Windows directory as the starting directory for wsl.exe that two backslashes \\\\ are required. Tab title \u2691 To open a new terminal instance with custom tab titles, use the --title argument. To set the title of each tab when opening two tabs, enter: Command Prompt \u2691 wt --title tabname1 ; new-tab -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" --title tabname2 PowerShell \u2691 wt - -title tabname1 `; new-tab -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" - -title tabname2 Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" --title tabname1 \\; new-tab -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" --title tabname2 Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running and the \\; forward-slash + semicolon separates commands. Using application title \u2691 To open a new terminal instance allowing applications within it to set the tab title by sending title change messages, use the --useApplicationTitle flag. To suppress these messages, use the --suppressApplicationTitle flag. If none of these flags are provided, the behavior is inherited from the profile's settings. To open a tab with title tabname that will not be overridden by the application, enter: Command Prompt \u2691 wt --title tabname --suppressApplicationTitle PowerShell \u2691 wt - -title tabname - -suppressApplicationTitle Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" --title tabname --suppressApplicationTitle Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running and the \\; backslash + semicolon separates commands. Tab color \u2691 To open a new terminal instance with custom tab colors, use the --tabColor argument. This argument overrides the value defined in the profile, but can be overridden as well using the tab color picker. In the following example, a new terminal is created with two tabs of different colors: Command Prompt \u2691 wt --tabColor #009999 ; new-tab --tabColor #f59218 PowerShell \u2691 wt - -tabColor #009999 ; new-tab --tabColor #f59218 Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" --tabColor #009999 \\; new-tab --tabColor #f59218 Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running and \\; separates commands. When --tabColor is set for a tab, it is associated with the first pane of this tab. Hence in a tab with multiple panes, the color will be applied only if the first pane is in focus. To set the tab color for additional panes, you will need to add the --tabColor parameter to the split-pane subcommand as well. In the example below, a tab with two panes is created with tab colors specified for each pane: wt new-tab - -tabColor #009999 ; split-pane --tabColor #f59218 Color scheme \u2691 To open a new terminal instance with a specific color scheme (instead of the colorScheme set in the profile), use the --colorScheme argument. This argument overrides the value defined in the profile. Command Prompt \u2691 wt --colorScheme Vintage ; split-pane --colorScheme \"Tango Light\" PowerShell \u2691 wt - -colorScheme Vintage ; split-pane - -colorScheme \"Tango Light\" Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" --colorScheme Vintage \\; split-pane --colorScheme \"Tango Light\" Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running and \\; separates commands. Tab focus \u2691 To open a new terminal instance with a specific tab in focus, use the -t flag (or --target ), along with the tab-index number. To open your default profile in the first tab and the \"Ubuntu-18.04\" profile focused in the second tab ( -t 1 ), enter: Command Prompt \u2691 wt ; new-tab -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" ; focus-tab -t 1 PowerShell \u2691 wt `; new-tab -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" `; focus-tab -t 1 Linux \u2691 cmd.exe /c \"wt.exe\" \\; new-tab -p \"Ubuntu-18.04\" \\; focus-tab -t 1 Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running cmd.exe . The /c option tells CMD to terminate after running and the \\; backslash + semicolon separates commands. Examples of multiple commands from PowerShell \u2691 Windows Terminal uses the semicolon character ; as a delimiter for separating commands in the wt command line. Unfortunately, PowerShell also uses ; as a command separator. To work around this, you can use the following tricks to run multiple wt commands from PowerShell. In all the following examples, a new terminal window is created with three panes - one running Command Prompt, one with PowerShell, and the last one running WSL. The following examples use the Start-Process command to run wt . For more information on why the terminal uses Start-Process , see Using start below. Single quoted parameters \u2691 In this example, the wt parameters are wrapped in single quotes ( ' ). This syntax is useful if nothing is being calculated. start wt 'new-tab \"cmd\" ; split-pane -p \"Windows PowerShell\" ; split-pane -H wsl.exe' Escaped quotes \u2691 When passing a value contained in a variable to the wt command line, use the following syntax: $ThirdPane = \"wsl.exe\" start wt \"new-tab cmd ; split-pane -p `\" Windows PowerShell `\" ; split-pane -H $ThirdPane\" Note the usage of ` to escape the double-quotes ( \" ) around \"Windows PowerShell\" in the -p parameter to the split-pane parameter. Using start \u2691 All the above examples explicitly used start to launch the terminal. The following examples do not use start to run the command line. Instead, there are two other methods of escaping the command line: Only escaping the semicolons so that PowerShell will ignore them and pass them straight to wt . Using --% , so PowerShell will treat the rest of the command line as arguments to the application. wt new-tab \"cmd\" `; split-pane -p \"Windows PowerShell\" `; split-pane -H wsl . exe wt --% new-tab cmd ; split-pane -p \"Windows PowerShell\" ; split-pane -H wsl . exe In both of these examples, the newly created Windows Terminal window will create the window by correctly parsing all the provided command-line arguments. However, these methods are not recommended currently, as PowerShell will wait for the newly-created terminal window to be closed before returning control to PowerShell. By default, PowerShell will always wait for Windows Store applications (like Windows Terminal) to close before returning to the prompt. Note that this is different than the behavior of Command Prompt, which will return to the prompt immediately.

When I started my blog I wrote about how to do things with given languages. From C# to databases, to Rails, to Node/etc. I still write about those things.

Long tail keywords are very specific and you have a higher chance of rating higher on Google. Guess what happens when you rank higher on Google? More exposure. What happens when you get more exposure? More people know about you. This is a fantastic way to start blogging. Simply share what you\u2019ve worked on, and how it worked for you or share a fix to an error that was very tricky that you could not find an answer for online. Most likely, others are running into this as well and they can\u2019t find a solution. Posting your solution on your blog will help them out. This will lead to more exposure, FOR YOU. This is a good thing \u2026 let me tell you a quick story before I wrap up \u2026 In 2009, my first full-time independent contract was coming to a close. I was getting paid $90 an hour as a web dev. I was blogging one to two times a week using this method above (sharing what I learned, how to fix errors, etc) and all of a sudden I got a cold email from a guy named Jesse from the contact form on my blog. Jesse worked as a contractor at GMAC (now known as Ally Bank). He saw that I was writing about some of the stuff they were dealing with at GMAC and asked if I had any capacity to help them. A week later I had lunch with their team to see if it was a fit (it was a mini interview for the team and to gauge my knowledge) and I was a fit! In about 2-3 weeks I started working at GMAC for $125 an hour. \u2013 a 28% raise \u2026 from a blog post. This contract lasted almost two years and then I eventually wrote the Android book and moved onto Android consulting. I\u2019ve seen this happen to MANY people over the years. MANY. Long story short \u2013 this ONLY happened because of my blog. Jesse was a reader of my blog and saw that I knew what I was talking about. I was simply sharing the knowledge that I had learned from coding and doing my day to day duties. This turned into an opportunity \u2013 a very lucrative one. So yeah \u2026 my blog does make money. How? Exposure. It exposed what I knew to Jesse, through some indirect way \u2013 he found it online, perhaps through a search, someone sending a link to him, who knows. I still don\u2019t know to this day how he found it. That led to him emailing me and then before I knew it, I was working with him and his team. If I had NOT been blogging, I would not be in the position I am in now. I\u2019m not saying this exact thing is going to happen to you, but I do know a blog has helped my career immensely and I\u2019ve seen it help others in fantastic ways too. Which brings me to \u2026 The two best things I\u2019ve ever done in my career has been to start blogging and start speaking \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re starting to see why now. If you don\u2019t have a blog, there are many places you can set them up. Some are great, others \u2026 not-so-much. I\u2019ll talk about the various options you have in the next email \u2013 stay tuned.

Long story short \u2013 this ONLY happened because of my blog. Jesse was a reader of my blog and saw that I knew what I was talking about. I was simply sharing the knowledge that I had learned from coding and doing my day to day duties. This turned into an opportunity \u2013 a very lucrative one. So yeah \u2026 my blog does make money. How? Exposure. It exposed what I knew to Jesse, through some indirect way \u2013 he found it online, perhaps through a search, someone sending a link to him, who knows. I still don\u2019t know to this day how he found it. That led to him emailing me and then before I knew it, I was working with him and his team. If I had NOT been blogging, I would not be in the position I am in now. I\u2019m not saying this exact thing is going to happen to you, but I do know a blog has helped my career immensely and I\u2019ve seen it help others in fantastic ways too. Which brings me to \u2026 The two best things I\u2019ve ever done in my career has been to start blogging and start speaking \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re starting to see why now. If you don\u2019t have a blog, there are many places you can set them up. Some are great, others \u2026 not-so-much. I\u2019ll talk about the various options you have in the next email \u2013 stay tuned. If you haven\u2019t written anything for your blog in a while, or if your not sure even what you\u2019d talk about please hit the comment section below and let know. I\u2019d love to learn how I can help you get it started. \ud83d\udcf7 Lukas Blazek Links: Dann Felker.md Sources: You Need a Blog - DONN FELKER","title":"You Need a Blog"},{"location":"2-Slipbox/You%20Need%20a%20Status%20Page/","text":"You Need a Status Page \u2691 Yes, yes you do. You need a status page. No doubt about it. If your company has and API or a service that developers and customers consume you need to be able to give them an easy to find website where they can view the status of your system. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re failing as a company. You\u2019re failing to provide the proper service to your customers and developers. What do I mean by that? \u2691 Simple. How the heck do I know if your servers, databases, etc are up and running properly? For example \u2013 If my API requests to your cloud endpoints stop working, or my SDK to your system just stops. Is it my local environment or is it yours? What if is your system? What if your database is down and the service I\u2019m using goes down with it? How can I get notification updates? How do I know what\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m a paying customer or developer for your system \u2013 I rely on your system and I feel I deserve to know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m not alone, most other developers feel the same way. As a company, I\u2019m sure some of you are thinking \u201cWell, we will just update our twitter account.\u201d Whatever. Twitter updates suck. They work, but very few people immediately think \u201cWow, my app is broken and can\u2019t connect to ABC Companies API. I should look at their Twitter stream.\u201d Pfft. Yeah. Right. Emailing support sucks too, and for that matter, anything that cannot quickly provide a snapshot of your system status system sucks too. What most developers end up doing is looking for a status page of some sort. When GitHub goes down. How do I know? It stops working. What do I do then? I go to status.github.com \u2013 wow, problem solved \u2013 I realize they\u2019re down. If not, well, then I have more troubleshooting to do. Maybe it is my system, maybe its my DNS, who knows, but at least I know that the problem is not on your side! When Gmail or Google Docs goes down how do I know? Simple. I go to google.com/appstatus . If something is wrong, an icon will be present in the matrix of apps and I\u2019ll know if what I\u2019m using is broken. This helps me identify if my connection or system is acting wonky vs their system. So, how do you go about setting up a status page? \u2691 There are quite a few services out there and open source options too. I advise the hosted solutions as they\u2019re the easiest to get rolling with. But first let\u2019s handle this nonsense \u2013 But I want to build it myself and host it myself! Sure, you can build your own but it\u2019s a major pain in the rear and I don\u2019t advise it. Inventing everything yourself is a sure fire sign that you and/or your company suffer from NIH Syndrome . If something costs $100 a month and your time is worth $100/hr (trust me, it is) then if you cannot build it, maintain it, update it, etc for less than 1 hour a month with all the same features of the solution you\u2019re evaluating, well \u2026 you\u2019re losing money and you will have made a very poor business decision. So let\u2019s consider the \u201cNIH\u201d option as irrational and let\u2019s get reasonable here. Ok, I\u2019m not going to build one. How do I set one up quickly? \u2691 We have a couple of hosted options I prefer and one open source option I like too. Let\u2019s chat about the hosted solutions. Companies like Docker and Runscope (as well as many other companies) need a service that they can use to easily relay information to their developers and customers about the status of their system. Both of these companies use different tools, but either is fine. Status.IO : Example \u2013 Dockers Status Page Docker (a super awesome container company) has a status page located status.docker.com which shows you the current status of the Docker APIs, Forums, Website, etc. You can see the API resonse times, uptimes, you name it. All of this is powered by Status.io \u2013 a very good status page hosting company. Sign up here . StatusPage.IO Example \u2013 Runscopes Status Page Runscope (an API Monitoring and Testing company) has a status page located as status.runscope.com . StatusPage.IO is packed full of features and is very similar to Status.IO and used by many as well. Sign up here . Cachet Example \u2013 Cachets Status Page For those either hellbent on hosting it themselves or for those who are stuck inside of an enterprise conundrum, this might be a good option for you. I suggest forking the GitHub repo, then making changes in in that repo so you can easily merge in upstream changes at a later time. Download it here . Which One Do I prefer? \u2691 Good question. Definitely not Cachet unless that is your only option due to some corporate mandate you have to deal with. Personally the feature set and price point of Status.IO is perfect for me. If I were to recommend anyone to use one it would be them. Start Now and Become a Better Service Provider \u2691 Simply sign up to either of these hosted services, plug in the various components that need to be monitored (both sites have good docs) and then point your DNS to status.yourdomain.com. Please note, status.yourdomain.com is the typical status page domain that developers will attempt first. Some support experts advocate having another domain such as \u2013 yourcompanystatus.com which hosts your status page in case your DNS provider takes a nose dive too (so you\u2019ll need another DNS provider for that new status domain \u2013 if you go down that route). I\u2019ll leave that choice up to you. Just having a status page alone puts you ahead of your competition ten fold and makes your company more developer friendly, respectful and professional. * API Uptime Tip: On the same topic of uptime, Runscope offers tools to help notify you when your own API (or API\u2019s you rely on) start acting up. It\u2019s a service I\u2019ve personally recommended to many of my clients who have an API presence and is worth every penny in my mind (no, I was not paid to say this.

Library classifications use a notational system that represents the order of topics in the classification and allows items to be stored in that order. Library classification systems group related materials together, typically arranged as a hierarchical tree structure. A different kind of classification system, called a faceted classification system, is also widely used, which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in many ways. Types \u2691 There are many standard systems of library classification in use, and many more have been proposed over the years. However, in general, classification systems can be divided into three types depending on how they are used: Universal Schemes \u2691 Covers all subjects, e.g. the Dewey Decimal Classification , Universal Decimal Classification and Library of Congress Classification . Specific Classification Schemes \u2691 Covers particular subjects or types of materials, e.g. Iconclass (art), British Catalogue of Music Classification , and Dickinson classification (music), or the NLM Classification (medicine). National Schemes \u2691 Specially created for certain countries, e.g. the Swedish library classification system, SAB (Sveriges Allm\u00e4nna Biblioteksf\u00f6rening). In terms of functionality, classification systems are often described as: Enumerative : Subject headings are listed alphabetically, with numbers assigned to each heading in alphabetical order. Hierarchical : Subjects are divided hierarchically, from most general to most specific. Faceted : ( analytico-synthetic ) Subjects are divided into mutually exclusive orthogonal facets. There are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems; most systems are a blend but favoring one type or the other. The most common classification systems, LCC and DDC, are essentially enumerative, though with some hierarchical and faceted elements (more so for DDC), especially at the broadest and most general level. The first true faceted system was the colon classification of S. R. Ranganathan . Methods or Systems \u2691 Classification types denote the classification or categorization according to the form or characteristics or qualities of a classification scheme or schemes. Method and system has similar meaning. Method or methods or system means the classification schemes like Dewey Decimal Classification or Universal Decimal Classification. The types of classification is for identifying and understanding or education or research purposes while classification method means those classification schemes like DDC, UDC. English Language Universal Classification Systems \u2691 The most common systems in English -speaking countries are: Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) Library of Congress Classification (LCC) Colon classification (CC) Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) Other systems include: Harvard-Yenching Classification , an English classification system for Chinese language materials V-LIB 1.4 (2020 Vartavan Library Classification for 788 fields of knowledge (on 02/09/2020), based on the VARTAVAN-FRAME ( http://projectis.co.uk/proprietary-ip.html ) and currently sold under license in the UK by PROJECTIS CONSULTANTS Ltd ( http://projectis.co.uk ). London Education Classification devised by D.J. Foskett and Joy Foskett and used at the UCL Institute of Education Garside classification used in most libraries of University College London [11] Bliss bibliographic classification used in some British libraries Non-English Universal Classification Systems \u2691 German Regensburger Verbundklassifikation (RVK) A system of book classification for Chinese libraries (Liu's Classification) library classification for user New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries Nippon Decimal Classification (NDC) Chinese Library Classification (CLC) Korean Decimal Classification (KDC) Russian Library-Bibliographical Classification (BBK) Universal Classification Systems that Rely on Synthesis (faceted systems) \u2691 Bliss bibliographic classification Colon classification Cutter Expansive Classification Universal Decimal Classification Newer classification systems tend to use the principle of synthesis (combining codes from different lists to represent the different attributes of a work) heavily, which is comparatively lacking in LC or DDC. The Practice of Classifying \u2691 Library classification is associated with library (descriptive) cataloging under the rubric of cataloging and classification , sometimes grouped together as technical services . The library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a cataloger or catalog librarian . Library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate subject access . The other consists of alphabetical indexing languages such as Thesauri and Subject Headings systems. Library classification of a piece of work consists of two steps. Firstly, the subject or topic of the material is ascertained. Next, a call number (essentially a book's address) based on the classification system in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the system. It is important to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work, in library classification systems, each work can only be placed in one class. This is due to shelving purposes: A book can have only one physical place. However, in classified catalogs one may have main entries as well as added entries. Most classification systems like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress Classification also add a cutter number to each work which adds a code for the author of the work. Classification systems in libraries generally play two roles. Firstly, they facilitate subject access by allowing the user to find out what works or documents the library has on a certain subject. [12] Secondly, they provide a known location for the information source to be located (e.g. where it is shelved). Until the 19th century, most libraries had closed stacks, so the library classification only served to organize the subject catalog . In the 20th century, libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing. Some classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, Universal Decimal Classification , which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons, is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly faceted classification schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order. Depending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other. In extreme cases, a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system. Instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes (travel, crime, magazines etc.). This is known as a \"mark and park\" classification method, more formally called reader interest classification. [13] Comparing Library Classification Systems \u2691 As a result of differences in notation, history, use of enumeration, hierarchy, and facets, classification systems can differ in the following ways: Type of Notation: Notation can be pure (consisting of only numerals, for example) or mixed (consisting of letters and numerals, or letters, numerals, and other symbols). Expressiveness: This is the degree to which the notation can express relationship between concepts or structure. Whether they support mnemonics: For example, the number 44 in DDC notation often means it concerns some aspect of France. For example, in the Dewey classification 598.0944 concerns \"Birds in France\", the 09 signifies geographic division, and 44 represents France. Hospitality: The degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects. Brevity: The length of the notation to express the same concept. Speed of updates and degree of support: The better classification systems are frequently being reviewed.

Library classifications use a notational system that represents the order of topics in the classification and allows items to be stored in that order. Library classification systems group related materials together, typically arranged as a hierarchical tree structure. A different kind of classification system, called a faceted classification system, is also widely used, which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in many ways.","title":"Description"},{"location":"3-Reference/Library%20Classification%20System/#types","text":"There are many standard systems of library classification in use, and many more have been proposed over the years.

Hierarchical : Subjects are divided hierarchically, from most general to most specific. Faceted : ( analytico-synthetic ) Subjects are divided into mutually exclusive orthogonal facets. There are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems; most systems are a blend but favoring one type or the other. The most common classification systems, LCC and DDC, are essentially enumerative, though with some hierarchical and faceted elements (more so for DDC), especially at the broadest and most general level.

The library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a cataloger or catalog librarian . Library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate subject access . The other consists of alphabetical indexing languages such as Thesauri and Subject Headings systems. Library classification of a piece of work consists of two steps. Firstly, the subject or topic of the material is ascertained. Next, a call number (essentially a book's address) based on the classification system in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the system. It is important to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work, in library classification systems, each work can only be placed in one class. This is due to shelving purposes: A book can have only one physical place. However, in classified catalogs one may have main entries as well as added entries. Most classification systems like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress Classification also add a cutter number to each work which adds a code for the author of the work. Classification systems in libraries generally play two roles. Firstly, they facilitate subject access by allowing the user to find out what works or documents the library has on a certain subject. [12] Secondly, they provide a known location for the information source to be located (e.g. where it is shelved). Until the 19th century, most libraries had closed stacks, so the library classification only served to organize the subject catalog . In the 20th century, libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing. Some classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, Universal Decimal Classification , which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons, is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly faceted classification schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order. Depending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other. In extreme cases, a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system. Instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes (travel, crime, magazines etc.). This is known as a \"mark and park\" classification method, more formally called reader interest classification. [13]","title":"The Practice of Classifying"},{"location":"3-Reference/Library%20Classification%20System/#comparing-library-classification-systems","text":"As a result of differences in notation, history, use of enumeration, hierarchy, and facets, classification systems can differ in the following ways: Type of Notation: Notation can be pure (consisting of only numerals, for example) or mixed (consisting of letters and numerals, or letters, numerals, and other symbols). Expressiveness: This is the degree to which the notation can express relationship between concepts or structure. Whether they support mnemonics: For example, the number 44 in DDC notation often means it concerns some aspect of France. For example, in the Dewey classification 598.0944 concerns \"Birds in France\", the 09 signifies geographic division, and 44 represents France. Hospitality: The degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects. Brevity: The length of the notation to express the same concept. Speed of updates and degree of support: The better classification systems are frequently being reviewed.

However, if you have many subscriptions, create a management group hierarchy to help manage your subscriptions and resources. Azure Management Groups \u2691 Azure management groups help you efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for your subscriptions. Each management group is a container for one or more subscriptions. Management groups are arranged in a single hierarchy. You define this hierarchy in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant to align with your organization's structure and needs. The top level is called the root management group . You can define up to six levels of management groups in your hierarchy. Each subscription is contained by only one management group. Azure provides four levels of management scope: Management groups Subscriptions Resource groups Resources Any access or policy applied at one level in the hierarchy is inherited by the levels below it. A resource owner or subscription owner can't alter an inherited policy. This limitation helps improve governance. Tag inheritance is not yet supported but will be available soon. This inheritance model lets you arrange the subscriptions in your hierarchy so that each subscription follows appropriate policies and security controls. Figure 1: The four scope levels for organizing your Azure resources. Any access or policy assignment on the root management group applies to all resources in the directory. Carefully consider which items you define at this scope. Include only the assignments you must have. Create your Management Group Hierarchy \u2691 When you define your management group hierarchy, first create the root management group. Then move all existing subscriptions in the directory into the root management group. New subscriptions are always created in the root management group. Later, you can move them to another management group. When you move a subscription to an existing management group, it inherits the policies and role assignments from the management group hierarchy above it. Once you have established multiple subscriptions for your Azure workloads, you can create additional subscriptions to contain Azure services that other subscriptions share. If you expect your Azure environment to grow, you should create management groups for production and nonproduction now, and apply appropriate policies and access controls at the management group level. New subscriptions will inherit the appropriate controls as they're added to each management group. Figure 2: An example of a management group hierarchy. Example use cases \u2691 Some basic examples of using management groups to separate different workloads include: Production versus non-production workloads: Use management groups to more easily manage different roles and policies between production and non-production subscriptions. For example, developers might have contributor access in non-production subscriptions but only reader access in production subscriptions. Internal services versus external services: Enterprises often have different requirements, policies, and roles for internal services versus external customer-facing services.

Contents \u2691 Azure Management Groups and Hierarchy Scope of Management Settings Create a Management Level Create a Management Group Create a Subscription Create a Resource Group Learn More Actions Naming Standards Resource Tags Apply a Resource Tag Learn More Action Azure Management Groups and Hierarchy \u2691 Azure provides four levels of management scope: 1. Management Groups 2. Subscriptions 3. Resource Groups 4. Resources The following image shows the relationship of these levels: Management groups: These groups are containers that help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group. Subscriptions: A subscription logically associates user accounts and the resources that were created by those user accounts. Each subscription has limits or quotas on the amount of resources you can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects. Resource groups: A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed. Resources: Resources are instances of services that you create, like virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases. Scope of Management Settings \u2691 You can apply management settings like policies and Azure role-based access control at any of the management levels. The level you select determines how widely the setting is applied. Lower levels inherit settings from higher levels. For example, when you apply a policy to a subscription, that policy is also applied to all resource groups and resources in that subscription. Usually, it makes sense to apply critical settings at higher levels and project-specific requirements at lower levels. For example, you might want to make sure all resources for your organization are deployed to certain regions. To do that, apply a policy to the subscription that specifies the allowed locations. As other users in your organization add new resource groups and resources, the allowed locations are automatically enforced. Learn more about policies in the governance, security, and compliance section of this guide. If you have only a few subscriptions, it's relatively simple to manage them independently. If the number of subscriptions you use increases, consider creating a management group hierarchy to simplify the management of your subscriptions and resources. For more information, see Organize and Manage your Azure Subscriptions . As you plan your compliance strategy, work with people in your organization with these roles: security and compliance, IT administration, enterprise architecture, networking, finance, and procurement.

Naming Standards \u2691 A good naming standard helps to identify resources in the Azure portal, on a billing statement, and in automation scripts. Your naming strategy should include business and operational details as components of resource names: The business-related side of this strategy should ensure that resource names include the organizational information that's needed to identify the teams. Use a resource along with the business owners who are responsible for resource costs. The operational side should ensure that names include information that IT teams need. Use the details that identify the workload, application, environment, criticality, and other information that's useful for managing resources. Different resource types have different naming rules and restrictions . For more information and recommendations aimed specifically at supporting enterprise cloud adoption efforts, see the Cloud Adoption Framework's guidance on naming and tagging . The following table includes naming patterns for a few sample types of Azure resources. Avoid using any special characters ( `-` or `_` ) as the first or last character in any name . These characters cause most validation rules to fail . Entity Scope Length Casing Valid characters Suggested pattern Example Resource group Subscription 1-90 Case insensitive Alphanumeric, underscore, parentheses, hyphen, period (except at end), and Unicode characters <service short name>-<environment>-rg profx-prod-rg Availability set Resource group 1-80 Case insensitive Alphanumeric, underscore, and hyphen <service-short-name>-<context>-as profx-SQL-as Tag Associated entity 512 (name), 256 (value) Case insensitive Alphanumeric \"Key\" : \"value\" \"Department\" : \"Central IT\" Resource Tags \u2691 Tags are useful to quickly identify your resources and resource groups. You apply tags to your Azure resources to logically organize them by categories. Each tag consists of a name and a value. For example, you can apply the name \"environment\" and the value \"production\" to all the resources in production. Tags should include context about the resource's associated workload or application, operational requirements, and ownership information. After you apply tags, you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with that tag name and value. When you organize resources for billing or management, tags can help you retrieve related resources from different resource groups. You can also use tags for many other things. Common uses include: Metadata and documentation: Administrators can easily see detail about the resources they're working on by applying a tag like ProjectOwner . Automation: You might have regularly running scripts that can take an action based on a tag value like ShutdownTime or DeprovisionDate . Cost optimization: You can allocate resources to the teams and resources who are responsible for the cost. In the Azure Cost Management + Billing, you can apply the cost center tag as a filter to report the charges based on a team or department usage. Each resource or resource group can have a maximum of 50 tag name and value pairs. This limitation only applies to tags directly applied to the resource group or resource. For more tagging recommendations and examples, see Recommended naming and tagging conventions in the Cloud Adoption Framework.

Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects. Resource groups: A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed. Resources: Resources are instances of services that you create, like virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases.","title":"Azure Management Groups and Hierarchy"},{"location":"3-Reference/Organizing%20Resources%20in%20Azure/#scope-of-management-settings","text":"You can apply management settings like policies and Azure role-based access control at any of the management levels. The level you select determines how widely the setting is applied. Lower levels inherit settings from higher levels. For example, when you apply a policy to a subscription, that policy is also applied to all resource groups and resources in that subscription. Usually, it makes sense to apply critical settings at higher levels and project-specific requirements at lower levels. For example, you might want to make sure all resources for your organization are deployed to certain regions. To do that, apply a policy to the subscription that specifies the allowed locations. As other users in your organization add new resource groups and resources, the allowed locations are automatically enforced. Learn more about policies in the governance, security, and compliance section of this guide. If you have only a few subscriptions, it's relatively simple to manage them independently. If the number of subscriptions you use increases, consider creating a management group hierarchy to simplify the management of your subscriptions and resources. For more information, see Organize and Manage your Azure Subscriptions . As you plan your compliance strategy, work with people in your organization with these roles: security and compliance, IT administration, enterprise architecture, networking, finance, and procurement.","title":"Scope of Management Settings"},{"location":"3-Reference/Organizing%20Resources%20in%20Azure/#create-a-management-level","text":"You can create a management group, additional subscriptions, or resource groups.","title":"Create a Management Level"},{"location":"3-Reference/Organizing%20Resources%20in%20Azure/#create-a-management-group","text":"Create a management group to help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions.

Your naming strategy should include business and operational details as components of resource names: The business-related side of this strategy should ensure that resource names include the organizational information that's needed to identify the teams. Use a resource along with the business owners who are responsible for resource costs. The operational side should ensure that names include information that IT teams need. Use the details that identify the workload, application, environment, criticality, and other information that's useful for managing resources. Different resource types have different naming rules and restrictions . For more information and recommendations aimed specifically at supporting enterprise cloud adoption efforts, see the Cloud Adoption Framework's guidance on naming and tagging . The following table includes naming patterns for a few sample types of Azure resources. Avoid using any special characters ( `-` or `_` ) as the first or last character in any name . These characters cause most validation rules to fail . Entity Scope Length Casing Valid characters Suggested pattern Example Resource group Subscription 1-90 Case insensitive Alphanumeric, underscore, parentheses, hyphen, period (except at end), and Unicode characters <service short name>-<environment>-rg profx-prod-rg Availability set Resource group 1-80 Case insensitive Alphanumeric, underscore, and hyphen <service-short-name>-<context>-as profx-SQL-as Tag Associated entity 512 (name), 256 (value) Case insensitive Alphanumeric \"Key\" : \"value\" \"Department\" : \"Central IT\"","title":"Naming Standards"},{"location":"3-Reference/Organizing%20Resources%20in%20Azure/#resource-tags","text":"Tags are useful to quickly identify your resources and resource groups. You apply tags to your Azure resources to logically organize them by categories. Each tag consists of a name and a value. For example, you can apply the name \"environment\" and the value \"production\" to all the resources in production. Tags should include context about the resource's associated workload or application, operational requirements, and ownership information. After you apply tags, you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with that tag name and value. When you organize resources for billing or management, tags can help you retrieve related resources from different resource groups. You can also use tags for many other things. Common uses include: Metadata and documentation: Administrators can easily see detail about the resources they're working on by applying a tag like ProjectOwner . Automation: You might have regularly running scripts that can take an action based on a tag value like ShutdownTime or DeprovisionDate . Cost optimization: You can allocate resources to the teams and resources who are responsible for the cost. In the Azure Cost Management + Billing, you can apply the cost center tag as a filter to report the charges based on a team or department usage. Each resource or resource group can have a maximum of 50 tag name and value pairs. This limitation only applies to tags directly applied to the resource group or resource. For more tagging recommendations and examples, see Recommended naming and tagging conventions in the Cloud Adoption Framework.","title":"Resource Tags"},{"location":"3-Reference/Organizing%20Resources%20in%20Azure/#apply-a-resource-tag","text":"To apply a tag to a resource group: Go to Resource groups .

They are yet others too, and many other branches are still emerging. %% highlight_id: 210200583 %% The cloud has garnered quite some rapid popularity because it has opened a whole new vista in the world of internet.

These remote servers are used to store, manage and process data without the need for a local server or a personal computer. There are several advantages of cloud computing that enable companies and individuals to more efficiently use computer hardware and software. %% highlight_id: 210200529 %% The use of serverless computer networks has proven to help many companies provide more on-demand computer system resources. These resources on a serverless network include data storage and power for many computers in a network. The development of serverless computing has enabled many businesses to save money as well as have better access to certain data. Serverless computing has also allowed companies and individuals to use computers that run better with the enhanced power provided. %% highlight_id: 210200530 %% 8 benefits of the cloud for software developers %% highlight_id: 210200531 %% Scalability One of the main benefits of cloud computing is scalability. With traditional server hosting, users need to determine the exact hardware that each node of the system would run a particular web application or server. With cloud systems, users can now scale any part of an application more quickly and easily. %% highlight_id: 210200532 %% Cost Another benefit of cloud computing systems is that the cost is much less. Companies and users will be able to save money on computing costs as they will not need any upfront investment and will be able to pay as they go to get the resources they need. %% highlight_id: 210200533 %% Quick Provisioning of Resources Developers are now able to quickly create new environments for websites as well as databases and virtual machines. They are also able to get additional services that are always being expanded. %% highlight_id: 210200534 %% Multiple Service Models Cloud provides developers and companies with different options to set up their environment which will then meet the unique needs of users. These service models include Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. This has been made possible thanks to Itsm management software. %% highlight_id: 210200535 %% Geographic Reach Rather than rely on a single location to host software, cloud allows users to host applications in data centers all over the world. %% highlight_id: 210200536 %% Ease of Deployment A cloud system enables users to configure automated builds that can deploy certain code, databases, automated testing for applications and automatic provisioning of a particular server. %% highlight_id: 210200537 %% Advanced Services Cloud can allow developers and companies to use the most advanced services available These services include simplifying microservices and scaling service containers. This results in focusing on building the logic of a business instead of managing systems that are distributed. %% highlight_id: 210200538 %% Monitoring Developer Operations Developers can benefit from the cloud by being able to more easily monitor all of the operations and applications that they use. They can see application performance metrics, logs and monitoring tools to identify problems with a server or system before a user reports them. %% highlight_id: 210200539 %%","title":"Cloud Computing  8 Benefits for Your Software Developers   Dice Insights"},{"location":"3-Resources/Highlights/Highlights%20-%20Code%20Comments/","text":"Highlights - Code Comments \u2691 If the code is confusing \u2013 I try to refactor the code so that it\u2019s not confusing anymore. 1 If a refactoring is not possible, I document the \u201cwhy\u201d, not the \u201chow\u201d.

This rule states that if you haven't worn a piece of clothing in a year, you're probably never going to wear it again, so there's no point keeping it. There's something about the one-year mark that demarcates stuff that might actually be useful from those that are just probably not. This includes email. So divide up the inbox into messages that are a year old or older, from those that aren't. %% highlight_id: 209857920 %% Step 2: Out with the old Now that you've isolated all the emails older than one year, it's time for honesty. If I have not needed any of those emails by now \u2014 if I have not been bitten by ignoring them yet \u2014 then I will probably never need them. So I would declare bankruptcy and delete them all. Click the select-all box and then the trash can: %% highlight_id: 209857921 %% But this really freaks some people out. What if I delete something that's important that I end up needing later? Let me put on my \"Dad voice\" for a second: This is why you have to have good email hygiene in the first place. If you think that all that stuff might contain something important but don't know, realize this is a huge source of stress that you don't even realize is living in your head rent-free \u2013 until you get honest with yourself and have to click the trash can button. %% highlight_id: 209857922 %% But generally speaking, the idea here is to just delete the old stuff in a massive batch. This requires courage. However \u2014 in Gmail at least you can hedge your bets by choosing \"Archive\" instead of \"Delete\". This will put all those old emails out-of-sight/out-of-mind in an archive, out of your system but still accessible via a search later.

In other words, by 1:30 a.m., you\u2019re only halfway to completing the job of cleansing your brain of the caffeine you drank after dinner. %% highlight_id: 209449849 %% It is disquieting to learn that vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs combined. %% highlight_id: 209449850 %%","title":"Why We Sleep"},{"location":"3-Resources/Kanbans/","text":"Kanbans \u2691 Contents \u2691 < Place Directory Contents Here >","title":"Kanbans"},{"location":"3-Resources/Kanbans/#kanbans","text":"","title":"Kanbans"},{"location":"3-Resources/Kanbans/#contents","text":"< Place Directory Contents Here >","title":"Contents"},{"location":"3-Resources/Mindsweeps/","text":"Mindsweeps \u2691 Contents \u2691 < Place Directory Contents Here >","title":"Mindsweeps"},{"location":"3-Resources/Mindsweeps/#mindsweeps","text":"","title":"Mindsweeps"},{"location":"3-Resources/Mindsweeps/#contents","text":"< Place Directory Contents Here >","title":"Contents"},{"location":"3-Resources/Mindsweeps/Mindsweep%20Trigger%20List/","text":"Mindsweep Trigger List \u2691 Links: Sources:","title":"Mindsweep Trigger List"},{"location":"3-Resources/Mindsweeps/Mindsweep%20Trigger%20List/#mindsweep-trigger-list","text":"Links: Sources:","title":"Mindsweep Trigger List"},{"location":"3-Resources/Templates/","text":"Templates \u2691 Daily-Note-Template Default-Note-Template Mindsweep-Note-Template MOC-Template Project-Note-Template README-Template Contents \u2691 < Place Directory Contents Here >","title":"Index"},{"location":"3-Resources/Templates/#templates","text":"Daily-Note-Template Default-Note-Template Mindsweep-Note-Template MOC-Template Project-Note-Template README-Template","title":"Templates"},{"location":"3-Resources/Templates/#contents","text":"< Place Directory Contents Here >","title":"Contents"},{"location":"3-Resources/Templates/Default-Note-Template/","text":"<% tp.file.title %> \u2691 Links: Sources:","title":"<% tp.file.title %>"},{"location":"3-Resources/Templates/Default-Note-Template/#tpfiletitle","text":"Links: Sources:","title":"&lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;"},{"location":"3-Resources/Templates/MOC-Template/","text":"<% tp.file.title %> -
